6. Ensure sentiments and other analyses are demonstrated across different product categories.

### Outcomes
- Provide models and outputs for the above use cases along with performance metrics for each model.
- Share the data sources, as well as the train and test datasets, upon project completion.
- Deliver key summary and recommendation slides based on the analysis and model outcomes.
