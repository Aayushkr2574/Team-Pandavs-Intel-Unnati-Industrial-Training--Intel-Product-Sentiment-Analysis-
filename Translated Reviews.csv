Very fast!",05-07-2024,"Its very capable for modern gaming without disappearing the average user who games a lot. The stability is great. Its very fast, it never stutters, and doesnt disappoint. Its well worth the money. With a proper 360mm AIO cooler, it doesnt get too hot. I used an Asus TUF Gaming AIO cooler for gaming. Its pretty easy to install."

She's a beast, but so HOT!!",03-01-2024,"I guess everyone is right, these things are hot and then some.  I went with a off brand AIO, and for the most part I'm good.  It does get spicy when I'm rendering or doing some crazy multi tasking.Gaming seems fine, no issues.  I play all kinds of games, FPS, MMO's, survival, etc.  (Paired with a Gigabyte Gaming 4090 OC, Tforce 64 gigs 6000 M/T DDR5, samsung 990 pro NVME 2 tb x2, no OCing done by me.)I replaced a 5950x, which was having issues for some reason, just felt like it was getting slower and slower, thermal paste and heat were fine on it, never got over 60c with the beefier AIO I had on it.  Just took longer and longer to render things.  I guess I wore it out!I just think you'll want a good AIO, and/or a solid water cooling solution for this to really get the best out of it.  I'm not sure a air cooled option will do you any good, but hey I've been wrong many times, so there might be something that can handle the job.All in all, not bad, but it's not going to give you much performance boost over last gen, matter of fact I found out later 13700k beats it in a lot of tests, blargh!  Either way, its fast, and it runs everything great, so I'm happy till the next go around."

Running air cooled on DeepCool Assassin IV with ease",03-11-2023,"So far so good.  This CPU is a monster and runs very nicely and boosts to max clocks (6ghz on two cores and 5.7ghz on all cores) unlimited TDP settings but thermally limited at 90c with -60mV offset.  I have noticed that it runs a bit cooler than my previous 13900KF, especially when you consider the core to core deltas.  I use my PC mostly for gaming and encoding, so as long as you have a great case with plenty of air flow and a top notch cooler, you can easily run it air cooled without issues as it will just throttle itself when it hits whatever thermal maximum you set in the UEFI BIOS.In gaming workloads it never throttles though and stays at 5.7ghz all core boost the entire time with temps in CPU intensive games anywhere from the upper 50s to mid 60s and upper 40s to mid 50s in non CPU intensive games**Update**I have the CPU now at 5.8ghz with HT disabled and a -75mV offset and it's working like a charm and very stable in gaming workloads and encoding (it downclocks when it hits 90c for encoding workloads but for gaming it stays at 5.8ghz), which is amazing since it's on an air cooled setup, though the setup is as optimal as it gets for air cooling!  As for temps, they are a little lower than running it at 5.7ghz with HT enabled and a -50mV offset.  If I use a -75mV offset with 5.8ghz and HT enabled, my PC crashes.  So disabling HT definitely enables the CPU to use less power.If you're predominantly using your machine for gaming, then I definitely recommend turning HT off regardless as most games tend to run better with HT disabled.  But if you're using it for productivity or a blend of both productivity and gaming, then definitely turn HT on.The only mildly disappointing thing for me is that the memory controller isn't as good as I thought it would be.  Mine runs 48GB DDR5 7400 CL34 at 1.35V on the IMC, but to hit DDR5 7600 CL36 with stability I need to increase the IMC voltage to 1.41V which just isn't worth it if you ask me for such a minor bump in performance.  My previous 13900KF could do 48GB DDR5 7800 at 1.36V on the IMC.Core wise though, the CPU is definitely superior to 13th gen."

Much faster than my previous i7-6850k",19-03-2024,"So I finally upgraded my home workstation, and went to this new i9-14900K. It is incredibly fast. I had a Davinci Resolve video project file that I rendered on my old setup, the i7-6850K and it took just over 22 minutes to complete the render. On the new i9, the exact same file was re exported, took just over 8 minutes..! almost a 3x speed increase.! Also, when you speed up footage in Resolve, the old cpu could not play it back smoothly, it would jump and chug like crazy, the new i9, it plays it back sped up 800% no problems and I can actually see how it looks without having to export the entire video clip to see it playback the retimed footage smoothly. Applications open u p much faster too, but that could be more due to the pcie4.0 nvme system drive that is much faster than the previous version nvme I had in the old build. The one thing I do not like about the new cpu, is the number of pci lanes. You only get 20, 16 are pcie5.0 and 4 are pcie4.0. This wont be an issue for most people, but my old cpu had 40 lanes, allowing me to run 3 GPU's at the same time, and YES, I needed them, I use GPU rendering software that can use up to 8 GPU's in one system on one license and every additional GPU speeds up your render times a lot when rendering out 3D sims. With this new cpu, I can only run 2 GPU's and they run at 8x, cause they share the 16x, and that does leave me 4 full pcie4.0 lanes for the system drive. It is not a deal breaker, and the increased speed overall is well worth it. One thing EVERYBODY should be aware of, is these new intel chips have P cores and E cores. Something my old cpu did NOT have. E-cores can severely impact certain software performance. When I booted up the new machine and tried my Ableton DAW  for the first time, I was expecting to be so happy with a performance boost, and the software was literally almost unusable.! The E-cores were slowing the software down so bad, I could barely change settings in the preferences.! It was that bad. I had to install process lasso ( fantastic software that is free if you have never heard of it ) and disable the use of E-cores for Ableton and then it worked very fast and is great.!"

Powerful but Warm",08-05-2024,"Before you purchase this CPU please also purchase alongside of it purchase a 360 AiO as well, this CPU is in need of it. I'm not trying to say that to scare you but it runs warm. In my (asus) bios I turned on ""Disabled-Enforce all limits"" so that the motherboard doesn't try to do on the fly OC to keep temps low and stability up. I haven't had any crashes or stability issues at all. I did a full platform upgrade from the 10900k to this, I kept my RTX 3080 and the performance bump was actually fully noticeable. I'd say my average temperature for doing basic computing is around 37c with my Lian Li Galahad II Trinity 360. It's a monster of a CPU genuinely and if you are in the market for an upgrade don't hesitate you won't regret it."

i7-14700K is a significant improvement from i9-12900K",31-05-2024,"I decided the difference between the i7 and the i9 didn't justify the price difference, considering I was already getting about 1/3 more performance than my 12th generation i9. I wanted plenty of motherboard resources so I also bought the MSI MEG Z790 ACE, 32 GB of Kingston Fury 6400MT/s DDR5 and a 2TB Samsung 990 NVMe drive.Cooling had been a slight issue with the 12th generation i9, even with a 360mm AIO cooler, so I went custom loop. Along the way I found a GPU water cooler on sale and decided to install a lot of cooling. The Thermaltake 900 tower can take two 560mm radiators, but I wanted some disks, so I went for a 560x140 and a 280x140, both 45mm thick and backed by 6 fans. Four more fans feed air into the case and there's till plenty of clear space for more air to be dragged in.So what's the result? The processor runs at 85C worst case, and only two cores at that temperature. The fast DDR5 does make a significant difference. I initially ran it at 6GT/s then turned it up to 6.2 and finally 6.4. The last change is a 3.5% change in DDR5 speed and that gave me a 2.4% increase in system speed. I kept my old RTX3070 which used to run over 80C and now runs at 62C worst case. So despite more performance the system runs a lot cooler.I mostly run X-Plane 12, which runs the GPU and CPU very hard, continuously. After several hours the cooling water reached 36C and the worst core temperature was 85C. The processor just works. No stability issues with the standard settings on the MSI Z690 motherboard. There are three standard memory tuning options for 6.0, 6.2, and 6.4 GT/s and all work. This will do for me for a few years."

Insane performance at a cost",02-06-2024,"This processor is a speed demon. Gaming, editing, encoding, and whatever else you can think of, it can handle. The performance is there. The value for money is quite good too. Unless you really want top of the line, this chip effectively eliminates the i9 from consideration. 20 cores. 8P and 12E. Boost up to 5.6GHz on 2 threads. I swapped a 12600K for this part and I'm still kinda staggered at just how fast it is in heavily threaded apps. This is a perfect upgrade chip for somebody on an older 12th gen i5 or lower. I wouldn't consider building new with it however.There's a cost to this CPU though. Heat. And power draw. I have an Arctic Liquid Freezer III 360 AIO on this chip, and even with a sizable undervolt, it still throttles at around 230W running 100C. It feels like this chip is almost uncoolable. Unless you go full custom liquid cooling or something. I considered a large air cooler for this chip and I'm glad I went with an AIO. Buyer beware. This thing runs hot. It's also incredibly fast. If you can cool it this thing will fly."

Fast, but unstable when overclocked.",11-01-2024,"I built 3 systems using 14900 series. They all had serious stability problems when in use.  After researching for weeks and reinstalling OS with no better result.  I finally disabled overclocking ""AI overclocking"", which was running as high as 1.6v.  I also found a BIOS setting after running some tools and set it INTEL FAIL SAFE.  this allowed me to run the AVX2 stress test successfully.  It basically throttles the chip.I can't tell you the frustration this caused figuring this out.  Everything from chrome browsers to Adobe CS would crash randomly for no apparent reason every few minutes while all ""tests"" showed it was fine.  I lowered my refresh rate to 60 from 120, killed AI overclocking and set the INTEL setting and now have a very stable system. It outperforms my 5950x when encoding, which is impressive.  It does run HOT even with water cooling.  IF I had it to do over again, I would avoid 13000 and 14000 chips as there is a OODLE issue as well when it comes to gaming with Unreal 5.  Basically an unfixable hardware flaw that affects some chips.Here's the thing, you will not notice a difference as nothing I use with the exception of HANDBRAKE, ever comes close to maxing out the chip when in use.  Adobe CS uses my 3080ti and the intel quicksync iGPU simultaneously which rarely went above 40%, and usually was around 15-20 when editing.  HW encodes for HD were at 350fps, software, 250, intel 300.  So a small advantage in Adobe CS is why I went with the 14900K vs KF.System was using ""AI overclocking"" pushing it to 6.2 roughly single core.  Disabled in BIOS now.Specs: Asus z290a Wifi II, Corsair 96GB DDR5 5600, Samsung 990 Pro, CPU Water cooled, 3080tiSo the ""K"" is basically useless for me at this point and don't see myself doing it manually as it's just not worth it to me.  That said, when stable, it's a very capable chip."

6.2GHZ 8200mts cl38 Daily Driver.",04-04-2024,"This professional CPU isn't designed for the average user. However, if you're a tinkerer at heart, eager to dive deeper than the surface-level information often presented in YouTube ""videos"" (or should we say, commercials), this is unquestionably for you. I've acquired multiple units for various builds/configurations from a wide array of retailersBest Buy, Newegg, and others included.For those considering making a purchase, I highly recommend using an Apex/Apex Encore MOBO or another reputable 2 DIMM board, particularly for AM5 or LGA1700, if overclocking is your goal. A high-quality cooler is crucial; for those opting for an AIO, ensure it includes at least an 8th gen Asetek pump and a 360 Thickboy copper radiator with performance fansAvoid the aesthetically pleasing but functionally inferior Lian Li reversed SL Infinity Fans. Genuine static pressure fans, capable of efficiently doing the job, are what you need. Despite what your favorite YouTuber might suggest, you should prioritize efficiency over aesthetics.When selecting DDR5, opt for GOOD BINNED options. If a high-binned QVL compatible set isn't your choice, at a minimum, go for HYNIX A for single rank and HYNIX M for dual rank.The 14900K, when expertly tuned, becomes a gaming and multitasking powerhouseachieving 43 to 44k in R23, with 6.2GHz boosting, 5.9GHz across its 8 physical cores and 8 threads, and 16 physical e-cores at 4.7GHz for a total of 32 threads, of which only 8 are virtual. With hyper-threading and e-cores enabled, it supports 8200 to 8400 MTS CL38 DDR5 RAM, boasts sub-55ns bus latency, and sub-9.3ns FWL. It's a marvel in Aida64 full, minus SSD, burn-in stress test stability. Adjusting all cores down to 5.8 and boosting to 6.0 can further reduce bus latency to easily below 50ns...Did I mention overall CPU temperatures typically remain between 35 to 40°C under heavy gaming loads, rarely exceeding 50°C? Despite the capability of 3 EATX connections to easily deliver over 400W of power, I'd advise against exceeding 325W daily, as the performance gains beyond this point are minimal without extreme overclocking and cooling methodsincreased voltage requirements could significantly shorten the lifespan of your CPU. For tinkerers, this CPU is a dream come true.As of this date4-4-2024: We anticipate future silicon manufacturing constraints will evolve, but that's a discussion for another time.The X3D Elephant in the room: Don't worry, I own one, and this is about science, not purchase bias...We'll sidestep intricate discussions about CLDO, FCLK, and MCLK concerns, and why the substantial L3 cache has become an essential workaround for the instability caused by chiplet-based IMC in handling DDR5 for gamers. If the augmentation of the L3 cache wasn't primarily to address DDR5 issues stemming from the chiplet design, why not significantly enhance and accelerate the L1 cache? The design doesn't allow for it since it's not monolithic, which wouldn't be practical. Those well-versed in the subject matter understand this. While chiplets represent the future, we must acknowledge that this future hasn't fully materialized for every aspect of computing, allowing us to look beyond the ""normie YouTuber AMD cults.""Indeed, I own a 7800X3D build and absolutely adore it! It excels in gaming... primarily in GAMING! Thus, there's no cause for concern. Let's briefly touch on the ""benefits"" like reduced thermals and supposed platform longevity (as if motherboard chipset upgrades and advancements in power delivery methods don't occur... humor me, over the planned 6 years). I, too, long for Z390 features on my Z790 board (/end sarcasm), not to mention the potential for longer boot times when tinkering with DDR5 or PBO, or even under normal conditions, and texture stutter/tearing... oops, and all those other delightful topics Lisa tends to highlight without addressing the influence of influencers with communications degrees rather than computer science degrees.  Just having fun, do what you love!I don't blame Amazon, Intel, AMD, or Nvidia more than the other. Manufacturing and shipping issues happen. The chip I received from Amazon didn't meet my expectations, but my other purchases have been exceptional. By chance alone, the other four 14900Ks I've received from various distributors have been stellar!Note:Settings in pictures are daily driven....No stability concerns all AIDIA 64 Stress tested for multiple hours and hundreds of gaming/workload hours.  I can get bus latency down to under 50NS but need to decrease core clock to locked 5.8GHZ to stay at safe voltage....  Depends what needs done, either/or is screaming fast even 55ns at that Bandwidth."

IF YOU WANT THE AIR COOLED OPTION",11-02-2024,"I'm not going to go over the same performance reviews others have done, yes its very fast for only $550 its the king of the poor mans build PC. my last PC its replacing was a $1000 10980xe and looking at the numbers the 14900k in average is 70-77% faster than the 10980xe. the only disadvantage between the 2 was the 10980xe had 48 PCIe lanes and ran 32c to 56c hot.i can't say the same about the 14900k heat, its spreader is almost half of the 10980xe. you can't just simply add a stock cooler or a ""MC'watercooler"" and expect the problem will solve itself. this is the first CPU in my 26 yrs of building PC's you have to plan out your cooler set up.ever since a 2012 water leak from these Mc'watercoolers (all in one 2 fan radiator kits sold by name brands) Ive never trusted them cost me $1500 in damages. The only water coolers that don't leak for me were the ones i built but water cooling is expensive and you have to inspect them at least every 3 months for debris in the tank or leaks. with air i only have to clean the pc 2x a year.yes you can control temps with an air cooler, and get the same temps as a 3 fan radiator water cooler. I'll post the results without adding a watt limit in the mobo post screen.here is the parts i bought to air cool running the new cinabench 2024 for 30 mins i can get max performance on a defualt non OC not hitting above 99C on the P cores1. Noctua NH-D15 chromax.Black | Dual-Tower CPU Cooler | 140mm | Black2. Noctua NF-A15 HS-PWM chromax.Black.swap (this adds a 3rd fan for the air cooler you'll need it)3. FDXGYH 4 Pcs CPU Heatsink Fan Buckle PC Mainboard CPU Radiator Fan 12CM Wire Buckle Upper Hook Type Fixing Clip  (these buckles are compatible with noctus 140mm fans)4. Easycargo 40mm Heatsink Kit 40mmx40mmx20mm (this you place on the flat base of the noctua cooler will help dissipate heat)5. Easycargo 100pcs Heatsink Assortment Kit Small Cooler Aluminum Heat (these you throw on the back of your mobo on and around the mount brackets you'll me amazed how adding heat sinks on the back of the mobo will reduce temps)6. Thermal Grizzly Kryonaut (this is the best thermal grease cooler by 1-2c cooler than artic silver mx 6)7. Thermalright Intel 12th/13th Generation LGA1700 Anti-Bending Buckle ( a must add a little thermal grease on the cpu side flaps this buckle is 100% aluminum will al help dissipate heat.then i went to my mother board software options (mobo is an MSI MEG Z790 ACE MAX) select ""CPU cooler tuning"" select ""tower air cooling"" which will limit the wattage draw to under 300w also note if you are not using a Water Cooling Reservoir  you should also use this option, water cooling a 14900k and OC really does require a reservoir, and a 4x 120 fan size radiator if you're simply using a pre-built 2x fan radiator its not enough to handle the 14900k and the CPU is known for drawing 370w plus!!so using air cooled i got a 2371 score with no watt limiter option an temps were 78-100c on the p cores, and with the 300 watt limit the score was  2328 with temps 70-99c never hit 100c case the limiter would kick in. (note this is from CPU testing that punishes the CPU realistically i don't see this CPU going over 88c even on the most demanding game in 3 years.i personally do not recommend OC this CPU its already been pushed to its limits by INTEL at best for another 100 watts when all you're getting is 3-4 more FPS and that's not worth it. and all these people bragging a 6.2-6.5ghz OC, there just flexing for clout, then they take the CPU back to default. i already have my P cores spiking to 6.002 at 288-300 watts, and under 99c temps; adding 0.198mhz will meaning nothing for apps and gaming.personal note the MSI MEG Z790 ACE MAX Gaming Motherboard is absolutely amazing at squeezing out all the performance of the 14900k worth the $700 price never crashed during testing that 26 power phases is godly  compared to my last gen EVGA x299 dark had 12 phase...RIP EGA :("

I want to delid it but I don't see the need and here is whyEven if I can get it 20 degrees cooler it will not matter It will still need 3.5 to 4.2 volts to stay stable at advertised speeds.I am running it @ 5.4 GHZ all P cores and this thing is unbelievably reliable . And maybe 10 seconds extra to render vs 5.7 to 6.0 GHZI get the point that ppl want to have the Bragging rights to say that it runs that fast but it will gwt damaged guaranteed 400 watts is a lot for that little unit. I think that 5.4 5.3 5.2 is more than enough specially when you have a total of 32 threads and gaming is practically single threaded . And most games are GPU bound. I only use it in the gaming department for Flight simulator and have not seen it above 68 degrees.I had a 4770 k and still running strong at 4.5 GHZ in a very small case.Intel is a beast and this I 9 is very good . Future proof for at least 5 years to come .Note. I have delided at least 20 cpus and the ones that got damaged were the ones that got a lot of voltage . They are very heat resistant but voltage just kills them .I have been running this cpu 24 /7 not an issueNot a blue screenJust underclock and undervolt and you are good to go This thing is a monster .

I have it air cooled and can play Minecraft with shaders all day on it with my 4080GTX and 128 gigs of memory.  The only issue I have is probably my own fault, in that I learned that intel did that stunt where they introduced P and E cores.  I'm not sure if they are making straight performance core models by the time I write this but if you are a rabid gamer make sure you are getting that type of proc and not this proc.  Still, this proc will do just fine for me as I use this for hyper-v and development work.

Main improvement is lower power cost day-day",03-05-2024,"I upgraded from an 8700k to this 14700k nearly 8 years later. Performance-wise, the difference is fairly negligible to me, and that is reflected in the 'real' specs. Going from 6 cores to 20 cores isnt really a 3x+ increase when most of those cores are 'efficiency cores'. User benchmark puts 14700k as only being 47% faster than the 8700k, despite being 8 years and 6 generations apart.The main improvement from my point of view is the reduced idle/casual power use. My UPS tells me that for my 8700k/1070ti system I drew ~0.43 Kw, and my new 14700k/4070ti super draws ~0.31 Kw watching YT, browsing the web (includes fans, monitors, etc).Mostly just wanted more balance for the new graphics card, since that's what does most of the heavy lifting these days anyway.

Unstable at default oc settings on asus motherboard",10-05-2024,Even running at the default 6.1ghz turbo settings the processor is extremely unstable and causes constant crashing.  Only way to stop it is to go in bios and set the core ratio to 57 max for power cores and 43 for efficency cores. Drove me nuts trying to figure out the problem for months also buy a hefty duty power supply if you're buying a 40 series rtx graphics card constant crashing of apps and games from lack of power to the graphics card from even a 1000 watt supply

Oh ya!",08-05-2024,"It's a processor. It's like any other processor that processes, only better.It destroys video editing and processor intensive brush strokes in Corel Painter. It has no problem with any kind of processing you can throw at it.Runs hot and causes the cooler to spool up when playing poorly programmed games, but the water cooler is up to the task. Still, it reveals what games are just piles of trash code.Just remember to update your BIOS because it's still a relatively new processor. And stay away from Windows 11."

While doing benchmarks, a few Pcores would hit 100c while others would hit 92c. Ecores was about 87c and low of 83c on 4.3Ghz all Pcore and 4.2Ghz all Ecore. Offset voltage was at 0.3. After switching back to auto clock, I still managed the same temps, but getting 5.1-5.2Ghz on Pcore and 4.3 on Ecore. If my case allowed 120mm fans, I would of most definitely installed 240mm AIO cooler. That for sure would of helped with the temps and get me higher benchmark numbers.When it came to rendering a 20 minute 4k video on sony Vegas Pro 18 (IGPU only), it took about 15 minutes to complete it vs my I9 9900k that would of taken over an hour to finish it (RTX 3060). This system was meant specifically VR/light video editing. So, considering how fast it is on the rendering without a dedicated GPU, I am pretty excited about it. I haven't tried the VR aspect yet.Overall, if you are coming from a few gen older CPU and want to upgrade to the 14900k, you wont be disappointed."

I was worried the performance boost would be marginal but I was pleasantly surprised to get a solid boost on 1440p with my rtx 4080 super. Playing Helldivers 2, my fps went from mid 70s-90s to 120-140s at everything maxed out. Playing VR sims like il-2 and DCS has mostly eliminated little stutters and performance drops. Similarly, MSFS 2020 at ultra settings in populated areas provides a smooth and stable experience. My temps generally stay around 65 to 75 underload/demanding gaming. I have seen brief spikes to 80. I'm using an EVGA CLC 280mm cooler. I may need to reapply thermal paste."

Possibly better memory support than i9-13900K",05-04-2024,"Once they came down in price, I did get a i9-14900K as an ""upgrade"" from a i9-13900KF to  i9-14900K .  It's OK but I can't rave over it.  It is more of an sideways change rather than an upgrade.The i9-14900K is fast but not more so that a i9-13900K.  For me, the Cinebench R23 scores are about the same for 13th versus 14th gen.  Though the i9-14900K appears to run DDR5 more stably and at higher frequencies than the i9-13900K.  Also, the i9-14900K is enabled for XTU AI enable tuning in XTU but it's not that helpful.  I even wonder if it is worth getting a K at all, these CPU's are plenty fast for gaming without overclocking.I did NOT notice a significant improvement in the operating temperatures.  Maybe a slight improvement but I did flush out the cooling system and clean out the water block so I am doubtful that the running temps are better.  Also, I suggest that you NOT let these chips get anywhere near TjMax (100C).  I had one i9-13900KF literally fail due to allowing it to get to TjMax frequently when stress testing.  A second one became slightly flaky.I thought the built in ARC display support of the K version might be helpful since I intended to devote the graphics card to the gaming monitor and use the built-in ARC on a side display.  But as it turns out, it wasn't worth it for me.  If you are gaming with this level of processor, you really need a comparable graphics card but most of them will drive four displays.  IMO, you are better off getting a KF and spending the money so saved on better graphics card.The original asking price was insane, I bought it on a whim on a late night.  On the morning morning after, I had buyers remorse, tried to cancel but could not, so instead, I refused the package.  It took literally 6 months to get a refund.  That was rather irksome."

It's the perfect fit for this monster PC I just built.",07-12-2023,"A lot of people are upset with the 14900k because of the minimal performance leap thar came between it and the 13900k. I say who cares. If you have a 13900k, don't upgrade, but if you have an older PC or 12th Gen, this is a worthy upgrade. I absolutely love mine. It's a monster of a CPU.I honestly don't recommend air cooling it. It can get pretty hot and there are only a small handful of air coolers that can handle this 14900k without setting power limits (which most people don't know how to do, let alone even know what that means)If you're not doing a custom water loop to cool your 14900k, I recommend you do what I've done to cool mine, you dont neeeed to, but it helps. I have an AIO (All-In-One Cooler) and I setup a push-pull configuration on my radiator. That means I have 3 fans on the bottom blowing in through the radiator, and 3 more fans blowing up and out of the case. Both are blowing upward. It creates more airflow. One side is pushing the air, the other side is helping pull that air through. Then I got a thermalright contact frame. Any LGA 1700 contact frame should work but the thermalright version is cheap. It might say 12th/13th Gen but it will also work on 14th Gen. So get an AIO, setup a push-pull fan configuration and get a contact frame. It's helping my Temps significantly. I typically stay in the high 50's or low 60's during 4K gaming. This CPU draws a ton of power so you might see it bump up to 80° occasionally, for a very brief moment. (Maybe 1 second or less)"

Please note that the F in the 14700KF means NO iGPU",24-02-2024,"Wanted to purchase the unlocked version of the 20 core 14th gen processor and saw that this was a cheaper option at the time. All the description says is that ""Discrete graphics is required."" It would be much more helpful by adding a line that says the F version stands for no integrated graphics card. If you're doing any kind of workstation work such as video editing, most software will take advantage of the processor having an iGPU as well and so I'm actually losing performance with this model version. I'll have to return the item to purchase the correct version without an F. I would give it a full 5 stars if it had the line explaining the F version."

My station is primarily used as a work station though it scores well with PC Mark 10 and cinebench. 3D Mark declares the obvious that I need to upgrade my video card from several years ago. The ai over clocking helps in the bench marking significantly. Lot easier to overclock than in the early 2000's on my core 2quad.

So far so good.",22-10-2023,"Sorta came from a 13900k but I gave that to a relative after their x299/i9-7940x system began to have issues. He bought a z790 board and was amazed how far ahead the 13900k is in comparison an overclocked Skylake-X processor. He fixed the issue with the x299 system, but he decided to stay with Raptor Lake. All of which is okay by me because that old 13900k had no overclocking headroom, and I could only undervolt it by 5mv before it became unstable. I was going to buy another 13900k or maybe the ks version, but I decided to wait for the 14900k.The 14900k I got on the other hand has some overclocking headroom. I already set all P-cores to 5.8GHz, while keeping the double-core Turbo Boost at 6.0GHz. I also set the cache to 5.2Ghz and it's completely stable. I was not able to raise the multiplier at all with my 13900k. Just happy my 14900k isn't a lottery loser.While the clock of both the 13900ks and 14900k are the same, the 13900ks has a cherry picked memory controller. If you're looking to do a ton of RAM overclocking then the 13900ks may be the way to go.... but that's not to say if you'd get a 14900k with a good memory controller. Both my 13900k and 14900k work with DDR5-7200 RAM with XMP set, and no adjustments to the memory controller voltages.If you're buying the 14900k off the get-go and building a new system around it, then I recommend pairing it with a motherboard that has the BIOS Flashback feature."

A Monster CPU with One Major Caveat",20-10-2023,"I built PC with the new Intel i9-14900k, and I must say, it's a beast of a processor. Coming from an i7-8700k, the performance boost is nothing short of incredible. Multitasking, gaming, and content creation have all seen a significant improvement. Multithreaded applications and gaming experiences run smoother.  It's a productivity powerhouse. The clock speeds are no slouch either, making it excellent for single-threaded tasks and gaming. The major downside of this CPU is the heat it generates. Even with a high-end cooling solution, it tends to run hot, and that's something you must take into consideration when setting up your cooling solution. Be ready for this CPU to draw a significant amount of power at full load. It can put quite a load on your power supply and might necessitate an upgrade if you're not already prepared. The Intel i9-14900k is an incredible processor, and the upgrade from an i7-8700k is substantial. Its exceptional performance in various tasks justifies its price tag.

While I know the AM5 socket will last longer, anyways, every time I upgrade I also upgrade the motherboard. Very nice product, will recommend it."

Great performance",22-03-2024,"This is an excellent, stable CPU. Care must be taken to keep it cool. It is a hot running CPU. To avoid heat throttling at 100deg Celsius in heavy duty gaming or testing, order a high end liquid cooler. For professional work and easy gaming a big block fan cooler will be just fine as it is much more quiet. To save a little  money, if at all, the I9-13900K will work just as well performance wise."

Runs hot, get a good cooler!",17-01-2024,"Awesome CPU thing can handle anything and everything for at least my needs as a gamer, and programmer! HIGHLY SUGGEST getting a 360 AIO or a custom water loop, and a CPU bracket if you are getting this CPU. It run's very hot getting a CPU bracket cut down my temps about 5-10 degrees. I'm not sure how good air coolers are for this CPU but I've seen a lot of people not suggest it. I use a 360 AIO Loop and it works great at keeping this thing cool!"

I finally lost",17-02-2024,"I've built computers for more than 20 years, and I have never in my life had so much trouble booting with stock bios settings. I think I finally lost the silicon lottery. Using an Asus mb, I had to go into bios limit voltage and manually tune each pcore. Temps were wild and out of control 100°c, clock speeds were low thermal throttling, random crashes, blue screens inability to run simple programs without them crashing and shutting down. Tried intel xtu auto overclocking, ai suite, and asus ai overclocking via bios.. none of that worked. Had to just dig into bios, set limits, and manually tune each core. Now system is stable and solid. Been benchmarking and stress testing for a few days now. Temps are great, and I am happy. Not sure if mb is culprit, gonna get another board and test the chip. Just be ready for some trouble. Looked over many forums of others having the same issues."

Very happy with 14900K, the reviews are misleading. It's feels way better then they say it performs.",04-11-2023,"This CPU is amazing. Feels like magic. I have it running in an Asrock PG Sonic 700 series, with 32GB GSkill DDR5 7200, and a Crucial T700 2TB PCIe 5.0 SSD and Cooler Master Masterliquid Atmos 360. Anytime u do anything, even click a icon the cpu jump up to 6Ghz. And for me stay under 30C Idle and under 70C Max Load. Never mind what temperatures it runs at, I can't get it to throttle. Seems like all of its power is available on demand all the time. And I'm basically computing in Real Time. The 13900K was fast, significantly faster then the 12900K, and this CPU even though on paper it doesnt look like they did much, and in benchmarks it looks close, it still feels like 15-20% faster the 13900K when your using it. I feel like it runs cooler then the 13900K, the 13900K was the hot chip. I don't know how they do it. Like I said it's like magic how it stays at 6GHz and stays so cool."

Worth it if <13th gen",17-11-2023,Was going to wait until 15th gen to upgrade my 10900k but decided to go for it. While the 10900k is still a powerhouse this is a good upgrade and I am happy with. This processor is ridiculously fast and handles everything we would expect it to. Cyberpunk picked up 10fps with a 3080 but runs super smooth now at 4k with RT. I did pair this with a z790 Aorus and 32gb ddr5 6400.******** AT Own Risk*******  Suggest undervolting in bios if you know what you are doing. I am running this cpu 5.7 all cores - 1.24v on a custom loop. I see idle temps 31c - gaming 60c and cinebench 89c.  It will run hot if you're on air and do not adjust the default voltage.

MRK,,Most likely it is still the best medium -hated pc gaming processor in 2023.,06-03-2023,"INTROCome Ã¨ giusto che sia, anzichÃ© comprare portatilini e preassemblati, un vero nerd si costruisce il computer da solo, e oltre a questo, condivide la sua esperienza nell'antica arte del PC Building anche con amici e parenti. Mio fratello aveva necessitÃ  di utilizzare un computer, e immaginando la tristezza di vederlo con un portatile, un preassemblato o ancora peggio con un Mac, ho pensato di costruirgli un computerino su misura. E comunque, quale modo migliore di convertire qualcuno al PC Gaming se non con un computer assemblato con tanto amore fraterno?Ho deciso quindi di scegliere questo processore perchÃ© trattandosi di una build sostanzialmente da utilizzo scolastico + gaming, e con un budget relativamente limitato (ok l'amore fraterno e tutto ma non esageriamo), mi sembrava il miglior compromesso tra prestazioni e qualitÃ . Alla fine il venditore mi ha spedito il 12400F, ma io volevo il 12400, quindi ho fatto il reso, e ho comprato il 12500 che comunque Ã¨ identico a parte la GPU integrata e frequenze un pelino piÃ¹ alte, quindi lo posso recensire lo stesso visto che sostanzialmente sono lo stesso processore.Si tratta di un processore da 6 core e 12 thread, che non ha i fantomatici E-cores delle serie piÃ¹ costose (per sempio, il 12600 ha 6P-Core come questo piÃ¹ 4E-Core che aiutano nelle operazioni in background, specialmente se usate Windows 11), a una frequenza di 2.5 Ghz con un boost fino a 4.4Ghz se le temperature, il workload, e la vostra scheda madre lo permettono.Un processore di questo tipo eccelle nel gaming, ma non fa schifo neanche nelle operazioni piÃ¹ complicate, infatti questo processore si comporta benissimo anche nel video editing con Adobe Premiere.L'ho abbinato a una RTX3060 12G della Gigabyte e a 32Gb di DDR4 a 3200Mhz, il tutto su una Asus B660M-A Prime.PERFORMANCE E TEMPERATURECome dicevo prima, si tratta di un processore di fascia media particolarmente portato per il gaming, ma che gestisce senza intoppi anche le operazioni piÃ¹ ""professionali"". L'architettura di questi processori Intel di dodicesima generazione, dopo un'undicesima generazione abbastanza deludente, Ã¨ eccellente.Senza dare i numeri con benchmark e altre cose poco comprensibili, vi posso dire che nel gaming si comporta allo stesso livello del buon vecchio Ryzen 5 5600X, senza dubbio il miglior processore di fascia media assieme a questo. Non credo avrete problemi in gaming o produttivitÃ  utilizzando questo processore, ammesso che il resto dell'hardware sia all'altezza.Io lo utilizzo con delle banali DDR4 a 3200Mhz, quindi come performance siamo simili al 5600X che avevo su una mia build dell'anno scorso, se invece lo abbinate a delle DDR5 un po' serie puÃ² sicuramente superarlo anche se di poco.In ogni caso, nel gaming si comporta benissimo, specialmente se abbinato ad una GPU un po' seria (come la mia RTX3060). Non ho notato colli di bottiglia, specialmente nel caso di questa build, che sarÃ  usata con un monitor ""solo"" 1080p.Per quanto riguarda le temperature, si tratta di una CPU abbastanza tranquilla con un TDP di solo 65W. Al momento non ho un dissipatore, perchÃ© non mi Ã¨ arrivato, quindi sto usando il dissipatore stock incluso nella confezione. Mi aspettavo facesse pena, invece Ã¨ decisamente accettabile. Le temperature non superano i 70C in gaming, anche con giochi pesanti, mentre invece sfruttandola al massimo con un Cinebench, non supera gli 80C, che Ã¨ accettabile e ampiamente sotto la soglia di throttling di 100C. Anche il rumore della ventolina originale Ã¨ abbastanza contenuto, quindi boh, magari lo tengo con il dissipatore stock. Sicuramente comunque il mio case, un NZXT con 4 ventole aggiuntive, aiuta non poco, oltre a questo non mi fidavo del velo di pasta termica preapplicata, e ci ho messo la mia fidata Gelid GC Extreme, perchÃ© per un processore da 65W con il dissi stock sicuramente Ã¨ necessaria una pasta termica di livello Extreme.VERSIONE F O NON F? TRAY O BOX? GPU INTEGRATA?La differenza tra le due versioni sta nella disponibilitÃ  della GPU integrata. La versione F non la include, e generalmente costa un po' meno. A seconda della differenza di prezzo, valutate se prendere una o l'altra. Io non sono un fan delle GPU integrate Intel e cerco sempre quando possibile di abbinare una GPU dedicata, anche se scarsissima. In questo caso ho la RTX3060 che Ã¨ una buona scheda da gaming, quindi perchÃ© ho voluto prendere il processore con la GPU integrata? PerchÃ© con certi programmi che supportano la tecnologia Intel Quicksync, la GPU integrata non sta lÃ¬ a dormire ma viene utilizzata attivamente per l'encoding video o per altre operazioni, come per esempio la timeline in Premiere. Il fratellino utilizza Adobe Premiere che puÃ² sfruttare questa tecnologia, ma anche altri programmi di video editing o streaming la usano, come per esempio OBS Studio, che puÃ² sfruttare l'encoder video della GPU integrata per strimmare, lasciando libera la GPU dedicata per il gioco.In ogni caso, la GPU Integrata Ã¨ la solita Intel UHD, sul 12400 Ã¨ la UHD 730, sul 12500 la 770. Non l'ho testata molto nel gaming, ma comunque non aspettatevi chissÃ  cosa. La potenza di questa Ã¨ simile alle entry level dedicate sui portatili di qualche anno fa come la 930M o giÃ¹ di lÃ¬, quindi va bene per giochi leggeri. In ogni caso, non ha problemi di sorta quando si tratta di visualizzare video o immagini 3D non particolarmente complesse, regge senza problemi i video in 4k su youtube o giochini retro ed emulatori vari.Per quanto riguarda altre nomenclature criptiche, a volte vediamo Tray o Box, la differenza tra le due Ã¨ la presenza del dissipatore nella versione Box. Come dicevo sopra, il dissipatore Ã¨ scarso ma per una CPU come questa Ã¨ sufficiente. Se invece il dissi non vi serve, prendete la versione Tray.PRENDO IL 12400, 12500 O 12600?Secondo me, tra questi tre il migliore Ã¨ il 12400 e vi spiego anche il perchÃ©.Il 12400 e il 12500 sono fratelli, mentre il 12600 Ã¨ a tutti gli effetti il modello superiore.Partiamo dal 12500, questo processore ha la stessa base del 12400 ma con frequenze di base e di boost poco piÃ¹ alte, oltre che una gpu integrata leggermente piÃ¹ potente (ovvero la Intel UHD 770 contro la 730 del 12400). Le frequenze piÃ¹ alte in buona sostanza si traducono in un miglioramento statico in media del 5%, di piÃ¹ o di meno a seconda del workload, ma praticamente mai sopra il 10%. La GPU integrata Ã¨ di poco piÃ¹ potente, ma si tratta sempre di un'integrata scarsissima poco adatta per il gaming a prescindere. Se la differenza di prezzo fosse di una decina di euro ci potrebbe anche stare, ma onestamente non mi viene in mente nessuna ragione per la quale il 12500 merita di esistere a quasi 100â¬ in piÃ¹. Evitatelo. Io l'ho comprato solo perchÃ© mi serviva di fretta e il venditore ha sbagliato a inviarmi il 12400F anzichÃ© il 12400. Altrimenti non l'avrei mai comprato.Il 12600 invece Ã¨ su un altro campo da gioco, ed Ã¨ a tutti gli effetti il modello superiore. Come dicevo all'inizio, oltre ai 6 P-Core il 12600 ha 4 E-Core, oltre che frequenze piÃ¹ alte, e la versione K se volete overcloccare. Per il prezzo di quasi 150â¬ sopra al 12400, potrebbe anche starci se rientra nel vostro budget e fate multitasking intenso o molte operazioni di rendering. Nel gaming sono praticamente uguali, la differenza tra i due si percepisce a framerate elevati e risoluzioni basse, in giochi AAA magari in 4k sarete limitati dalla GPU nella maggior parte dei casi. In ogni caso, se si vuole assemblare un PC con un budget piÃ¹ alto del mio e magari abbinato ad una GPU piÃ¹ potente della mia 3060, potrebbe valerne la pena, anche solo per la presenza degli E-Cores.Comunque, ritengo che il 12400 sia lo sweet spot, da considerare per qualunque PC di fascia media, valutando eventualmente un upgrade tra qualche anno alla generazione 13xxx quando caleranno i prezzi.CONCLUSIONEChe dire, il 12400 Ã¨ una CPU di tutto rispetto, ad un prezzo molto conveniente tra l'altro. Ã eccellente in una build da gaming di fascia media, abbinato ad una GPU un po' seria, e non fatica nemmeno nei programmi di grafica professionali (utilizzati a livello amatoriale o scolastico).Sicuramente non vi sto dicendo niente di nuovo, ma lo consiglio appieno per build di fascia media e budget contenuto."

TechfanUK,,Bargain priced CPU - low power draw with great productivity and gaming performance! :),17-01-2024,I've owned more expensive CPUs - up to AMD Ryzen 9 and Intel 13900K. In most cases these were overkill and ran hot with high wattages! Most of the work I was doing offloaded everything to my GPU so having a beastly CPU was a waste.I've downgraded to this CPU in my main desktop rig. It's great for productivity software (music and design work) as well as gaming. I have it paired with a RTX 4000 series card and haven't noticed a significant drop in frame rates whilst gaming. (maybe 1-5 FPS) In most games I max out the monitor's 144Hz/FPS at 1440p.One different thing about this CPU over other Intel offerings is that it has 6 performance cores (with 12 threads - hyperthreading) and no low powered efficiency cores. (they are only really needed for laptops anyway to save battery power!)The CPU is also very efficient and runs quite cool. Mine is 26c when idle and 26-30 light tasks such as browsing the web. During gaming - the temps are usually in the mid 50s. Benchmarking (such as Cinebench and Geekbench etc) reaches mid 60s. I am using a two-fan DEEPCOOL AS500 PLUS air cooler with three case 120mm fans.All in all - very happy with purchase and highly recommend! :)

Aggling of 3 August 2023Ho disabled the Intel Turbo Boost and now, even when I play, it never rises above 68 ° C, thus lowering the temperature 10 ° C.Even if you lose those 4.4GHz, know that it is equally performing and you have no stability problems.So I update the 5 -star review Ferragostoð ¥ ¥ The Stock Digger has abandoned me, temperatures splashed at 100 ° C and then goes into protection.Apparently it must be perfectly mounted without it does not make it.So I replace it with a tower.I do not recommend using the stock if you don't want to run into these unpleasant inconveniences.I update to 4, in the hope of not having further problems."

Great CPU",13-12-2023,"So I am no tech guru or anything.  I cannot delve into the technical nuances of this cpu like some can.  What I can tell you is this.  The i9-13900k has significantly increased my productivity.  Being able to run multiple CPU heavy applications completely changed the way I work.  Yes I know this CPU runs notoriously hot, but it seems a good quality AIO tames it well.  I have the 13900k running on an Gigabyte Z790 Aorus Master X motherboard with 128 gigs of ram and I use the NZXT Kraken 360 Elite to cool it.  The Kraken Elite does manage the heat well and my systems idles at 28-29 degrees.  This CPU is way overkill for a gamer, but for someone like me that does a lot of 3D modeling and rendering, its great.  I do have the cpu slightly overclocked using the Intel Extreme Tuning Utility in automatic overclock.  I have not had any crashes and havent noticed any thermal throttling at all with this setup."

Will be dead on arrival or degrade over months",21-04-2024,"My first review ever. Intel has finally acknowledged this issue, search ""Regarding Reports of 13th/14th Gen Unlocked Desktop Users Experiencing Stability Issues"" on google.For me, worked great for about a month, then slowly started experiencing stability issues. Games would crash and get an occasional blue screen. After about 6 months, there were noticeable stability issues, with many games unable to boot past main menu, causing blue screen on launch, or experiencing frequent crashes. Friends in separate friend groups would always comment on my computer issues, showing bugs and crashes that have no apparent causes.After a year, my PC can only run super smash brothers melee with stability and even chrome tabs are crashing now. Discord has to be run on chrome because the app crashes every 10 seconds, I can't play any games. I had dedicated tens of hours into investigating only to realize it's been the CPU all along. I also had to upgrade my motherboard to accommodate this CPU and now I have to investigate if this CPU has caused irreparable damage to the motherboard. I expect Intel will be facing heavy financial losses due to influx of warranties as the issues become more and more public.Please look up ""Intel 13th and 14th Gen stability"" for more info, or ""Intel Raptor Lake stability"" on Google for further cases. Unacceptable for a company worth over $100B to push out a product like this."

Amazing processor, but check your CPU power management in BIOS",26-05-2024,"So, first thing's first. This is a genuinely powerful CPU that's been able to handle basically every task that I've thrown at it. It runs demanding tasks like encoding and gaming with ease.Now with that out of the way; Thermals. This thing gets hot, and I mean REALLY hot. If you're going with air cooling I strongly recommend a double tower, six/eight pipe Air cooler like the Corsair A115 or a Cooler Master MA824. If you are going the AIO route, anything LESS than a 360mm AIO will under perform. For that, go with any 360mm AIO from any brand of your choice. If you have the space, go with a 420mm AIO for the best results.Finally, there has been recent reports of CPU degradation and instability when using this CPU. I am using this with an asus ROG STRIX Z790-H motherboard and it basically JUICED the CPU like no tomorrow until I applied intel's Power settings for this CPU. This likely is the cause of the degradation. Be sure to check intel's website for recommended power settings. Also check your motherboard vendor for any bios updates as Intel has confirmed that many motherboard vendors are running the i9 13900k CPU out of intel's specifications.In conclusion here's my personal experience: The CPU functions, but I can not use Asus' AI Overclocking feature as I get a BSOD with the CLOCK_WATCHDOG_TIMEOUT error and apps will randomly crash. You probably shouldn't use any AI assisted overclocking feature if you can help it. Even running this at stock, there is still a substantial amount of performance in this CPU. If you have an older rig and are looking to upgrade your CPU, I would just wait for Meteorlake or just go with AMD.Final note: I am not using a contact frame on my motherboard for my CPU."

The best CPU I have ever had, and good price, too.  But beware of Z690 motherboards",22-02-2023,"I got this and a new DDR5 motherboard with Z690 chipset.  It didn't boot when I set it all up.  It turns out the Z690 needs a BIOS update to work with this CPU.  Luckily I had an older i7 that worked on this motherboard.  I dropped it in and it booted, then I did the BIOS update.  After that it boots this CPU just fine.Before this I was a die-hard AMD supporter.  I had 5950x with 16 cores, 32 threads, and 72MB of cache.  But, it just doesn't compete with this i9.  I haven't tried the 7950x, but I read that the P-cores just blow away the AMD cores.  Even with less cache.  The setup of 8 performance cores, and 16 efficiency cores just works.  It stays much cooler than earlier i9's and the AMD.  I use a water cooler, but it's not required.  Nothing slows this down when paired with DDR5.I wish the AMD was better, I like the company more.  But, I want the best of the best, and as of today there is nothing better than this available.  If you game, or do graphics, or anything on your PC this is the CPU for you.  It will NOT disappoint.A word on the X790 chipset.  You would think they will have better performance because they are newer.  They don't.  They will work with the i9 no matter what, while the Z690 might need a BIOS update.  They have one more USB port.  But otherwise there is no benefit to getting Z790 and they cost a LOT more.  So, if you have the ability to use an older CPU to flash the bios, or find one that is new enough that it doesn't need the update, this CPU will be great."

Great processor, but failed quickly",29-12-2023,"This CPU unit is a beast, upgraded from a i7 8700k...the improvement was HUGE. Doubled my FPS in WoW, and there is no more lag! Nevertheless, after 6 months of regular use, it started failing...many kernel errors until it finally became useless. I could, somehow, return it to INTEL (from PerÃº to USA). Great support outside US...but such a complex and expensive unit cannot fail that quickly without heavy usage, at least in my opinion."

Great CPU and Really Fast Will Not Overheat If You Set It Up Correctly",14-11-2023,"I really like this CPU and it has worked well for my needs. Many had the issue of overheating, throttling and even bending in some instances. I have not experienced any of this since I knew exactly what settings needed adjusted in the BIOS to keep this monster CPU running cool. It seems that motherboard manufacturers tend to turn these up way past their limits by default and that was what caused all the issues. All you need to to is look up the specs for your CPU and setup the BIOS of your motherboard accordingly.I am using the Aorus Waterforce X 280 with Artic MX-6 Thermal Paste just in case you are curious. This has also been installed on the GIGABYTE Z790 AORUS Elite AX motherboard.As long as you set this up correctly you will not have any issues and will get a great performing CPU."

Crank up the A/C and forget your heater this winter.",11-11-2023,"Like the title says and all the reviews say, this thing is a beast.  Make sure you have a good cooling solution lined up.  Even without overclocking this puppy will handle anything I've thrown at it with ease.  But like all the reviews you see online say, it puts out some serious heat.  I've had it for about 4-5months now, before it started cooling off outside I was have to crank the A/C to keep my gaming room cool and now that its cooling off outside (30-40 f at night) I have blocked off the vents in the room to prevent any additional heat.  This thing paired with a RTX 4090 keeps this room plenty warm enough for me!  So on the plus side, I'll be saving on heating this winter!!"

Insane Performance",19-09-2023,"When it comes to going over the top for a PC upgrade, this CPU is the undisputed heavyweight champion. I, too, dabble in video editing, 3D modeling, and an array of demanding tasks, and let me tell you, this powerhouse just devours them with sheer gusto. Paired with a Kraken water cooler, it operates like a well-oiled machine, showing absolutely no signs of throttling, even under the most intense workloads. And as for those so-called ""CPU-intensive"" games, well, they might as well be child's play for this beast. If you're seeking the best of the best, look no further â this CPU is the crown jewel in the kingdom of processors, and it's here to make your computing dreams come true. It's not just top-tier; it's top of the world, and it laughs in the face of anything you throw its way. A true marvel of technology that's worth every penny!"

Worth it",10-08-2023,"This processor is a beast especially paired with gtx 4090 graphics card. I can edit videos and play games both at 4K settings together no problem and it doesnât generate that much heat either. I previously had a 2080ti paired with 6900k and was very happy with it until everyone was transitioning to 4K so sadly I had to retire my old build. Just a heads up to anyone who plans to pair 13900k with 4090, donât be a smartass and try to put it in small case, you will regret it later. I personally recommend big case with high airflow like fractal design torrent mid size atx but if you donât want to spend too much money on graphics card and happy with getting something like 4060 then you can get the nano version of fractal torrent. Good luck gamers and editors. Just remember if gaming is the only thing you do then no point spending this much just go a step down on processor. AMD processors are better if gaming is the only thing you do."

I do have a 12900k, and many other types and they all perform as expected. I would recommend Intel processors to those looking for something for general all around performance.

Great CPU, go with an i5 or i7 if just gaming though",28-09-2023,"Using Phantek Glacier D30 360mm cooler, during heavy stress load it gets around 82-84C. Just gaming in heavy modded Skyrim, FFXIV, and Total Warhammer 3 stays around 50-55C.Those complaining about temps higher than that while just gaming likely do not have their cooler mounted properly or too low end of a cooler.Make sure coolers plastic film is removed from metal block if it has that, apply plenty of thermal paste if cooler doesnt come pre applied with any, and evenly screw on the mounting screws to keep pressure as evenly as possible till all are set."

Indescribably good",15-05-2023,"Itâs so good, and that makes sense since itâs top of the line right now (imagine that.) Going from my 9900k to this was like a spiritual enlightening but ALSO I must add this is totally unnecessary unless youâll be working with heavy loads, unreal engine, 4k video editing and streaming, 4k gaming, or anything that requires overclocking.Buying this bad boy will future proof your computer for now, BUT there are very few people who NEED this kind of cpu. If youâre shopping for your build right now and considering this, if itâs in the budget and you want something thatâll handle literally whatever you want then yes, this is great. But just remember, whatever you want might not be as intense as this thing accounts for.Now that Iâve warned you about not needing this; let me just say how happy I am that I got it. I do a lot of 4k editing and streaming and there is no issue, runs smoothly and efficiently (does get hot though) if youâve got a good cooler on this then youâll be good to go for a long time."

Over clock at your risk",24-02-2023,"I bought two of these from Amazon after one from another vendor failed to POST.  Both worked the first time.  Do you need 24 cores for games?  Most games use 4 or 6 cores max, so probably not.  Video editing can benefit from the extra cores.  Intel supports XMP (extreme memory profile) and this processor is unlocked (it can be overclocked).  Overclocking increases the power consumption and heat; therefore, one needs a robust cooling solution.  Overclocking can void your warranty which is strange since Intel allows and even promotes overclocking with the Intel Extreme Tuning Utility.  I have the NZXT Kraken x 73 RGB liquid cooler.  With the NZXT CAM software you can see the CPU (and GPU) temperatures and control the fan speeds, reducing the risk of damaging the processor.  While idling (at 5.5 GHz) the CPU temperature is 30 C.  Under a 50% load or overclocked the temperatures are below 60 C.  Pros: Good for video editing Cons: A bit pricey for a gaming computer.  Don't overclock without monitoring temperatures to keep below 60 C."

Recommend Extreme Caution",11-03-2023,"This thing puts enough heat out to power a thermal generator, and I really am not kidding. Water cooling ONLY unless you want to melt your board or destroy the high dollar part. I would also recommend a large radiator too, 3 fan coverage. This thing is an excellent space heater.Outclasses thread ripper by almost double its paces per benchmarking in multicore. Handles everything I throw at it then yawns at me as if it was boring and mediocre work.Simply put, leader of the pack right now and handles literally anything Iâve tried to hit it with, even running multiple games at once (when combined with a good GPU, naturally).I have zero complaints. Iâve learned to hate a lot of intel items over the years, but this truly is a marvel."

Excellent, beware it does not come with a FAN",29-05-2023,"Excellent processor. It is a beast in gaming and in productivity, for the price I believe is unrivaled. Beware that you should separately buy a CPU Cooler because it does not come with one.Also beware that most Motherboards nowadays put no restraints to this processor in the BIOS, so they let it draw unlimited power and with that comes a very hot temperature limit. For example I'm using an 360mm AIO cooler and with the stock motherboard settings of my AORUS ELITE AX when running cinebench it reaches 100Â°C within 12 seconds of starting. Of course this temperature is only seen in stress tests and never during games (there, the max I've seen the CPU get is 67Â°C) but is something to be aware of.All in all happy with this beast"

Worst warranty support i have ever dealt with or it does not support windows 10 or 11.",02-07-2023,"It worked fine for 6 months, then i start running into Error Code 0xC0000005 with lots of various applications in Windows 11.  I figure it was after an update and they turned on some security thing, and I dissabled all the security stuff and still running into issues.  I reset the OS, still issues, I do a fresh clean install, still issues.  I try replacing the memory, still issues.  I try installing win 11 with a different boot installer, still issues.  I try windows 10.... still issues.  I try reinstalling it 2 more times, still the same issue.I decide to go to Micro Center to have them diagnose the issue, while i am there, their windows 10 install crashes with the same error code.  They take it in, and in 2 days message me saying its the CPU.  They tried the CPU in a different motherboard and the issue still shows up.  So, i go and pick up the machine.I try to file a warrenty claim with Intel, but their login system was broken for a week, so I had to chat with a support person.  We spend 1 hour typing about the issue.  I send him screenshots of the CPU itself, the text from Microcenter, the recepit from Amazon, screenshot of the Bios showing all my hardware information, a screenshot of the recepit from microcenter, a screenshot of the error code.I wait a week or so, i can finally log into Intel website, and i dont see a support ticket.  I open up chat again,  i tell them my ticket and they tell me that it wasnt assigned to an email address.  They assign it and forward the support response to me.And the response says, they cant contact Microcenter to confirm it.  And that its not a CPU issue anyways because that code is due to an OS issue.An OS issue.  I ask them to reiterate their point, because if its an OS issue, that means they dont believe me and Microcenter.  I also pointed out again that i have installed Windows 10 and 11 at least 5 times.... and they respond with, i need documentation from Microcenter.  So, they dont believe me and they believe this is an OS issue still.It has been 11 days and they wont move forward unless I send the documentation from Micro Center now.Works great, but hope you never have to file a warrenty claim because its going to take at least a month and thats if your lucky."

Probably Not for you Though",28-06-2023,"If it have the money to spare and want a processor that'll last you at least 5 years (and are a power user like I am) its a good choice. But most people say the advantages over the 13700k aren't worth it to most users.If you're just using the PC as a high-end gaming rig an i7-13700k is more than enough even with a 4090 GPU. This processor is designed to benefit more advanced users so I'd save the 150$ and get the cheaper 13700k. Also this processor is notoriously hot, so a beefy noctua air cooler or preferably a 280mm+ watercooler AIO is necessary (especially for overclocking)."

In overclocked mode the processor consumes over 300W and heats to over 100C even with the best cooler. Without overclocking it consumes about 250W and heats up to 89C under the full load (which is acceptable).

Fast and hot",28-03-2023,"I use it for computation (not games) with a noctua d15 (1 fan). On all cores (some openmp stuff I wrote) it goes 5.1GHz on the performance cores and 4.1GHz on the efficient cores (in a 23C corner of a room). The temp moves between 90 and 100 C. How I handle that, emotionally, is to have enough in my bank account to get a 13600k overnighted. Having said that, I've been at it for a little over a month and there has not been a glitch. Paired with an asus strix 790-e."

Incredibly Powerfull!",15-03-2023,Just installed this in my new build and I have to say it is AMAZING! My one warning to anyone inexperienced with the newer CPUs is be prepared for the heat. After a lot of work I was finally able to get this down to an average of 30 - 40 degrees Fahrenheit during light loads. When under a heavy load such as Cyberpunk at max everything at 4k. I get about 70 - 79 degrees Fahrenheit. This beast is HOT! but utterly incredible in its performance.

Do you feel lucky?",30-10-2023,"This I9 chip is very likely guilty of destroying 2 ASUS ROG Maximus Hero Z790 motherboards.  The first motherboard was ordered from Amazon with this chip.  The second was a replacement sent by ASUS for a relatively small fee compared to the cost of the first.  Picture number 1 is the offending chip.  Picture number 2 is the socket of the first motherboard after it destroyed it (picture taken by ASUS service).  Picture number 3 is the socket of the replacement motherboard ASUS sold me cheap AFTER this I9 destroyed it (wife's picture).  Since it arrive 15 Sept, Amazon says they can't help me.  Intel is thinkimng about what they are going to do.  Bottom line:  I'm out $900 for motherboards and Amazon and ASUS have declined to help any more.  We'll see what Intel does.  I've spent ~15 hours dealing with this: setting up and taking apart a computer that still doesn't work (no motherboard and a MB killer CPU), and support calls.  Moral of my story: Unless you feel lucky, DO NOT buy a motherboard and CPU and count on them working together.  Rather, just pay some integrator to sell you a motherboard, CPU, and memory that have been tested to work together."

I regret buying it, I regret spending all the money on my new build when I should have just went with AMD. In a year or so I am going to try to sell off the 4080 and other parts and just chunk this piece of garbage into a landfill.___The computer is only stable in power saved mode in the power options. With most games that are intensive, as soon as the CPU is needed, stuff just starts crashing. You literally have to throttle this CPU down to have system stability. The windows battery saver mode if you look at the hidden registry files, it alters the CPU by throttling it down.

According to Geek Squads' advanced support, Intel has had a recent production problem with this CPU. They say it's not uncommon to go through 4 or 5 CPU's before finding a good one.

I bought an ASRock z790 PG lightning /d4 board to go with it so I could use my existing DDR4 ram.  The difference was night and day!  I have an ID-Cooling 280mm AIO (cheapest I could find on Amazon) with a contact frame and kyronaut thermal grizzly extreme paste and does not thermal throttle on Cinebench R23 unless I run 3 or 4 passes back to back.  I am thrilled with how well this CPU runs.I was able to bump my DDR4 up to 4200mhz in gear 1 (timings cl20/26/26/26/48) after a bios update from ASRock and this thing is rock solid and crazy fast!  I get an average of 30500 in cinebench r23 and it will overclock as far as you want - I have taken it to 5.7 and it runs fine, it just thermal throttles quickly at that speed.  I'm pretty sure I could overclock this beast to the moon if I threw a lot more money into a custom cooling loop, but it is plenty fast as is.

Its blistering performance, PCIe 5.0 and DDR5 support, and overclocking headroom make it a future-proof powerhouse. However, the high price, heat generation, and DDR5 compatibility requirements might be dealbreakers for some. If you're looking for the ultimate in gaming and multi-core performance and have the budget for a premium build, the i7-13700K is a worthy investment. Just be prepared to feed it some serious watts and keep it cool.Note:This review is based on my own research and comparison of benchmarks. Your results may vary depending on your specific hardware and software configuration"

Good CPU, working well in gaming",08-01-2024,"The media could not be loaded.
                
In general - all mentioned in this review products are as described and working as described. Almost all deserve 5 stars (commented if one or more stars are taken off). Instead of reviewing item by item I decided to write one review for all products used for one specific PC build. The purpose of this PC build - fancy compact gaming system.Items used in this build:--Item 1) OCPC Mini ITX Case, Hydra Italy Mini ITX PC Case, Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BK6D77DG/Very good case â compact, cool looking and efficient. The black color is the only variant I found on Amazon. With only cooling from top-down CPU cooler, the i7-13700K based system passed the stress test very well. Riser cable is not included â actually the riser cable for GPU orientation as shown on Amazon item photo does not exist. In order to build the system as shown, I bought a flexible riser cable (Item #2) and twisted it to 180Â°. Another simpler solution is to install GPU upside down as presented by other reviewers on Amazon.--Item 2) EZDIY-FAB PCIE 4.0 16x Extreme High Speed Flexible Riser Cable PCI Express Port GPU Extension Card-Dual Reverse Connector for ITX [21cm]. Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09S5DW3RX/-Does the job - exactly what I need for the project. Note: During system build I have to remove the bracket from the cable male connector and install it back after passing cable through the case hole.--Item 3) Power supply: Cooler Master V750 SFX Gold Full Modular, 750W, Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08LP7B7FM/- Works as supposed to. PSU had a noticeable burning smell for about 5 days, considering this is normal for a new PSU. If you want to build more powerful gaming system, I recommend the PCIe 5.0 ready 850W SFX PSU, something like ARESGAME GL850 https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0CHDS4J33/SFX-L PSU will work in Hydra Mini as well, but cable management will be tougher.--Item 4) CPU: Intel Core i7-13700K, Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BCF57FL5/- Good CPU, working well in gaming.--Item 5) Motherboard: ASUS ROG Strix B760-I Gaming WiFi, Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BR8TVLPL/- Working as described, nice looking MB. Thank you, ASUS - now ROG motherboards have the Memtest86+ built in BIOS. This very helpful feature allows PC builders to check memory before operating system installation and prevent blue screens and failures during OS install and system use in case of defective memory.In my case originally ordered CORSAIR DOMINATOR PLATINUM RGB DDR5 RAM 64GB (2x32GB) 6400MHz (Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0C1R95SPW/) was defective. Both memory modules came to life and showed ok in BIOS but Memtest86+ got errors. I did test modules one by one in the same memory slot and found out that one of the modules is the cause of the failures. Returned the defective memory and bought another from a different brand (Item #6). ASUS ROG Motherboard chosen for the look. In my opinion the best Intel (or may be overall) mini ITX MB on the market is MSI MPG Z790I Edge WiFi Gaming Motherboard (Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BHCJ6KQ2/ ) I own one and have a very best experience.--Item 6) Memory: TEAMGROUP T-Force Delta RGB DDR5 Ram 64GB (2x32GB) 6000MHz, Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BNTV1945/-Very good product, works as described, nice looking, recognized by Aura Sync.--Item 7) Graphics Card: MSI Gaming GeForce RTX 4060 Ti 16GB, Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0CCFZMHSM/- Graphics card work as supposed to, have low power consumption. This GPU was chosen for the look only. Anyway, the presented system can play all modern games well at 1440p. But if you want the very good gaming experience, I will recommend at least RTX 4070 Ti like MSI Gaming GeForce RTX 4070 Ti Ventus 2X 12G OC. And the very best (talking about built on Hydra Italy Mini Case) will be the system with 850W PCIe 5.0 SFX PSU and:a) Â MSI MPG Z790I Edge WiFi Gaming Motherboard, Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BHCJ6KQ2/b) Intel Core i9-13900KF, Â https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BCFM3CJ4/c) ASUS ProArt GeForce RTXâ¢ 4080 16GB OC, ( Amazon https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C75J66C8/). This compact GPU has included Graphics Card Holder which will work with presented builtI own all of these (a,b,c) components packed in another fancy mini ITX case (Phanteks PH-ES217A_BK02 Evolv Shift 2 Air Mini-ITX case, Fabric Side Panels) and they performed superb in games.--Item 8) SSD Disks:8.1) Primary (system): WD_BLACK 2TB SN850X NVMe Gen4 PCIe M.2 2280 WDS200T2X0E, Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0B7CMZ3QH/8.2) Secondary (backup and media data): Crucial P3 Plus 4TB PCIe Gen4 NVMe M.2 CT4000P3PSSD8, Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0B25M8FXX/- Very good products, works as described, no problems.--Item 9) Antec Power Supply Sleeved Cable, PSU Cables, PSU Extension Cable Kit / 1x24pin ATX / 2x8pin (4+4) EPS / 3X (6+2) pin PCI-E, 30cm Length with Combs, Dual EPS Red Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BN3H2K17/- Perfect fit for this project, good cables, looks nice.--Item 10)CPU cooler: ID-COOLING IS-67-XT Black 67mm Height Low Profile CPU Cooler, Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0CFPY9CKZ/- Good design, keeps i7-13700K adequately cool in open Air PC Case. Mounting for regular size 120mm fan included. Easy installation - just install radiator 1st and mount fan after. ID-COOLING IS-67-XT chosen because of black color. In my opinion DeepCool AN600 Low Profile CPU Cooler (Amazon https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C4P8ZPWT/) has a little bit better cooling performance (I have one in a very compact Flex ATX build).--Item 11) EZDIY-FAB Moonlight 120mm RGB PWM Case Fan, Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07X8T79QY/Good, quiet and nice-looking fan. Actually, it is a leftover piece from a 9 fans ATX tower system build. If you want to build a similar system with a similar look, I recommend Cooler Master MF120 HaloÂ² Fan Duo-Ring ARGB (Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BWKZGYXJ/). This fan has a similar look but has better airflow / air pressure.---Item 12) 24 Pin RGB Cable Extension Kit (used ARGB strip only), Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07WN4G7KC/- The power cable connector to MB too tight - did not go all the way down, afraid to broke the MB if try to apply more force (the regular PSU cable fits perfect). Connector to PSU too tight as well, but was able to connect all the way down. Actually, in reality the system with this cable does not look good (too much RGB). Did use ARGB strip only for decoration purposes on the GPU side.--Item 13) Thermal Paste: ARCTIC MX-6. Optional - I have a very good experience using this thermal paste brand and always using it for the builds (so thermal paste provided by ID-COOLING was not used). Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09VDLH5M6/-----------Overall, I assume the goal is reached - the presented system can play recent games and look very cool (in my humble opinion)."

The quality you expect from Intel",16-05-2024,"Purchased on sale for $334. The 13700k is the best value CPU if you require enough speed for high-end gaming + productivity (e.g. video editing/rendering, streaming, multitasking, etc). This thing is fast. I was able to undervolt it and overlock it to 5.5 Ghz (all p-core) and 4.4 Ghz (all e-cores). I could go higher if I wanted to spend more time on it, but this was a quick overclock. Perfectly stable and runs (relatively)cool with the undervolt. Intel is still my preference for CPUs and I don't foresee that changing, especially with all of the issues I've read regarding AMD chips (boot up issues, crashes, poor multi-core performance)."

Great CPU - can't go wrong!",06-12-2023,"My previous build had an i7-9700K and after 5 years of abuse, I decided to upgrade in this new build to an i7-13700K and I'm not disappointed.  It's a great CPU and is handling everything I throw at it.  Stays cool even without a fancy AIO / liquid cooling setup.  During the process of installing the CPU on the socket, it fell into place perfectly, but when adjusting the motherboard arm to secure the CPU into the socket, it did feel I had to put a bit more force than I would have thought necessary, but it clicked into place and is running smoothly with no issues.

Outstanding performance and utilities!",26-12-2023,"The highest package temps my CPU gets while running multiple applications is 85 degrees Celsius. And that's only for brief moments. Average 68 - 75 degrees while gaming with high graphics games with youtube running in the background. Maxes at the 253 rated watts for me, which really is fine. Average of about 100 watts and computer overall idles @ 65 watts, which is 25 watts less than my old i7 4th gen. No need to undervolt this CPU, even though you can, you'll just be giving yourself future headaches if you do. During the Cinebench stress test you get temps that max out at 98 - 100 degrees Celsius, but remember that's absolute max mode, 99% of users will never use this CPU for more than several minutes at. If Intel's Extreme Tuning Utility does not automatically download when installing, definitely get it from intels website and learn to use it. It is easy to use, and you won't regret it. I just use it for monitoring performance, but you can use it for easy optimize and under/overvolt with too, but I'd recommend doing any of that through your motherboard BIOS if you decide to. Most new BIOS's are easier and safer for that kind of stuff anyway. Do your research on which to use and how. Long story short if you want max performance to play around with just get a i9 processor, that's what those are made for, for everyone else there's this one!"

Stable System",01-11-2023,"I use this i7-13700K every day for about a year. I have Crucial RAM 64GB Kit (2x32GB) DDR5 4800MT/s CL40 Desktop Memory CT2K32G48C40U5 modules (4 of them), a Corsair RM1000x (2021) Fully Modular ATX Power Supply in a Phanteks Enthoo Pro Full Tower Chassis without Window Cases PH-ES614PC_BK in service for about one year as I write this review. For the most part, assembly was very easy. I do video editing, audio editing, streaming, wordprocessing, browsing and email with my setup. I use all of my SATA ports and even have a plug-in eSATA card for more ports. So most of my drive bays are filled. The cpu, dram and everything I have connected to my power supply and motherboard has been rock solid stable, and the case holds in all together. It just works exactly the way I want and have no anomalies. The power supply, motherboard and all components run cool in the case with an i7-13700K CPU, 128 GB of Crucial DDR5-4800 that is clocked at 5200 automatically set by the motherboard itself. My video card is a the very modest ASUS GeForce GT 1030 2GB GDDR5 HDMI DVI Graphics Card (GT1030-2G-CSM) because I transitioned my ancient setup from MBR to GPT and needed to be able to boot the old system in the new motherboard before updating the Windows 10 Pro config to GPT UEFI and still be able to boot legacy devices. Everything just worked like a Swiss Chronograph. I strongly recommend this cpu, dram, the power supply, the case, the ASUS ProArt Z790-Creator WiFi 6E LGA 1700, the Asus video card, and am also recommending the Crucial MX500 SATA drives I use. Is it all of this the fastest? I have no idea. Does it boot and work reliably everytime so far? Absolutely!"

Huge upgrade from Ryzen 5800X, cut my Visual Studio/Dotfuscator compile times significantly",14-05-2023,"Nice!  I upgraded from an AMD Ryzen 7 5800X to this CPU (and the components below) and I couldn't be happier.  Everything opens almost instantly, whether it be Windows 11's File Explorer, Edge browser and webpages, and opening files in general.  I upgraded primarily because I am a developer, and Visual Studio + Dotfuscator would take almost 8 minutes to compile and obfuscate my largest program on my old build.  After upgrading, it now compiles in about 4 mins 45 seconds.  The longest part is Dotfuscator, not Visual Studio compiling.  Compiling happens in seconds on this setup.My components:

Everything runs smoothly, I haven't had a single crash running the XMP Profile in BIOS for my RAM so it runs at full speeds.  This CPU blows the Ryzen 7 5800X out of the water.  Check out the UserBenchmark: AMD Ryzen 7 5800X vs Intel Core i7-13700K comparison on UserBenchmark's website for details, which is what I did before purchase.  It lives up to the benchmarks for me."

Great CPU, but hard to cool",19-06-2023,"After too many years of gaming on an old i7-6700K I finally decided to pull the upgrade trigger this year.  I purchased the most up to date CPU and other components with the hope this one will last me as long as the last one did. Overall I think this is a great CPU, however it is a bit frustrating when you try to cool these things. Intel just keeps pushing these CPUs harder and harder to try and beat the performance metrics of AMD, but in the process they are making CPUs that are anywhere from near impossible to difficult at best to keep cool. After a lot of tweaking in the BIOS I finally got this one to stay below the 90 degree Celsius threshold, but that doesn't account for how hot it still makes my room when I'm gaming. The extra heat was kind of nice during the winter months, but as summer is approaching I'm wondering how this is going to pan out...Anyway, the CPU is completely as advertised and worked flawlessly out of the box. I didn't run into any errors or issues with this CPU. Overall I 100% recommend it because Intel has never let me down. I've been building my own systems for more than 20 years now too, so that's a pretty long track record of CPUs that just worked and never died. Because of that I can easily recommend this CPU and I would definitely order it again."

This processor works faster and better compared to what I had previously. This cpu is basicaly like an efficient i9 12900k, so if your looking for a high end processor just get this 13th gen. Also at this time the 14th gen i7 just got released but based on the reviews its more like a 13th gen Intel ks proccesor. That why I never went that route."

Who needs an i9! This thing is amazing!",01-02-2023,"I built a new computer during the height of covid (Dummy, I know, right?) and decided on a i9-9900k. I'm a sysadmin by trade, so remoting in and fixing servers has never been an issue with that processor..but for gaming..Titles like Cyberpunk, Days Gone, to even WoW..there were areas that my 3080 was being bottlenecked by the 9900k.I coupled this CPU with a MSI EDGE z790 DDR4 (I have fantastic Samsung B-Die CL14 3600 DDR4 from the previous build). So far, in Cyberpunk I'm seeing 25-30 more FPS on 1440p Ultra settings w/ Raytraycing on High. WoW is getting 50+ more FPS, and I'm getting over 100 FPS in Valdrakken, where I was getting 45-50 FPS with the 9900k with the same settings as cyberpunk (1440p ultra (10 graphics settings).I'm using the Corsair iCUE H100i Elite LCD 240mm AIO, with Thermal Grizzly Kryonaut Extreme thermal paste to cool this bad boy, and even at prolonged sessions in Cyberpunk, my temps are not getting above 65c. And no, I have not done the Contact Plate mod.TL;DR - This CPU is blazing fast, and if your current processor is a few years old it may very well be worth the upgrade. I don't claim to be Steve from Gamers Nexus, or a pro CPU tester - but I can tell you that this thing is amazing, and will serve you well for years to come."

Fantastic Performance/Value Workstation CPU",23-01-2023,"The i7-13700K has i7-12900K performance at an i7 range price range. Please note I used an older Z690 EVGA Classified Board. I was required to flash because older boards cannot support the new CPU yet. I suggest people who used a 12th gen chipset and were looking to upgrade follow their respective motherboardâs vendor manual. The installation was incredibly easy, and I booted the BIOS after the BIOS update without any problem. I had hit 5 GHz on the CPU without overclocking. It also supported 6000 MHz DDR5 RAM without any issues after enabling XMP. The reasonable pricing for Z690 or Z790 boards makes the i7-13700K a good combo compared to AMDâs expensive Ryzen 7000 CPUs and motherboard costs. For people who are still on older generations, the vast E cores and P cores offered by Intelâs 13th gen make it worth it to accomplish CPU-intensive tasks like Handbrake or Adobe Premiere. This CPU runs cool with a 360 mm AIO and a high airflow case (around 30-36 C idle temperature for me). I also like to note the CPU fits only fits one way and the CPU lever has a bit of tension, so donât be afraid when installing your CPU."

Screaming fast processor that runs really hot.",15-01-2023,"I got this for a new system build even though a little higher than I like to spend. But it has performed great.After, I noticed a drop in performance and doing research, I found out that these run very very hot and the thermal protection had kicked in to throttle the processor down. I tried a few Air cooled options that did the trick, but they were too loud for me, so I ended up with a Liquid cooled option which is what I would recommend to anyone using this processor. Currently, my idle temps are around 41c and at 100% utilization, temps average around 60-70 with a quick peak of 95. I dont personally like to overclock for my own reasons, but I did do some overclocking on this for testing and everything worked great with what I did. 13th Gen blows away 12th gen. This I7 even bests the i9 12th gen. Great chip as long as you keep it cool."

Very Fast in 2023",06-08-2023,"The i7 runs a bit hotter than the 13th gen i5, but I just couldn't resist spending a bit more for those extra cores. As of 2023, it's a razor-fast CPU for the average buyer - probably too powerful for anyone but power-users and video-editors. As for gaming, it'll run many older games at a high FPS even without any help from a GPU, and it handles modern titles without any problems, too.It CAN run with a low-power or stock-quality cooler for daily tasks, but I'd recommend investing in water cooling if you plan to throw heavy-duty loads at it, or good-performance air cooling if you're planning to buy it once and keep running it many years into the future."

For those who are on the fence about upgrading from 12th generation Intel",07-12-2022,"Above are screenshots of my Passmark benchmark, both systems exactly the same, except the first picture has the 13700K and the second picture has the 12700K in it. The rest of the components are HX1200, Asus ROG Maximus Hero Z690, Gskill Trident DDR5 F5 6000Mhz, Adata Legend 840 SSD  X2 set up in RAID 0. Vetroo Lurker 240mm AIO water cooling, Power color RX 6900 XT. I run all (P) cores synced at 5300 MHz. Temps idle at about 32 to 35C, hard benchmarking takes it up as high as 88 C once, typically about 75C. Ordinary gaming, tasking takes it to about 45 to 50C.If you are wondering if its worth the upgrade, it is. But considering that my system is one of the fastest in the world with these components, I would have to say that upgrading to a Z790 motherboard is NOT worth it if you already have a Z690.That is all, and good day to you."

Absolute beast-gaming overkill",10-04-2023,"If youâre looking at this as a gaming-only processor, youâll probably get 95% of the gaming performance this offers with the cheaper and cooler i5-13600k. Save your money and put it into a better GPU over buying this because that will actually result in more FPS where this processor (over the 13600k) will not.That being said, this processor is a monster. Itâs a bear to keep cool but it has the performance to back it up. Most stable and speedy system Iâve ever owned. 13th gen might have come out before Ryzen 7000 series, but I still think itâs the winner.EKâs Nucleus 360mm AIO did a great job at keeping this CPU under control."

The New Generation",23-04-2023,"This was the first Generation 13 processor we used in a build. Of course the actual build procedure is no different than before so not much can be said for that. Our test show it is about 9% faster than its same-numbered 12th generation.  The other thing we did see from our tests is that again 12th vs.13th the newer processor appears to run about 2Â°-3Â° C lower in temperature under somewhat similar conditions. All in all, obviously we will be doing our building going forward with 13 series processors we can't see justification for anyone taking their i9-12900k out and installing i9-13900k. The gains would probably not be really experienced."

Lightning fast, but runs hot",13-02-2023,"Amazing CPU, noticed huge improvements in performance almost everywhere (faster load times, higher FPS in games, etc.) Performance was especially noticeable in CPU heavy games such as WoW, that don't require as much GPU power and are heavily bottlenecked by CPU. In cases like those I doubled FPS going from 9th gen to 13th gen Intel.One thing to note: 13th gen Intel is HOT! You may be coming from an older CPU and used to 60-70 C temperatures at max, then you might think you did something wrong when this one hits the lower 90s a lot. That's just how it is. If you're worried about longevity, set an undervolt offset of about -0.10 (preferably in your motherboard's BIOS settings) and the temps will drop by about 10 degree with no loss of stability."

I play all kinds of games, FPS, MMO's, survival, etc.  (Paired with a Gigabyte Gaming 4090 OC, Tforce 64 gigs 6000 M/T DDR5, samsung 990 pro NVME 2 tb x2, no OCing done by me.)I replaced a 5950x, which was having issues for some reason, just felt like it was getting slower and slower, thermal paste and heat were fine on it, never got over 60c with the beefier AIO I had on it.  Just took longer and longer to render things.  I guess I wore it out!I just think you'll want a good AIO, and/or a solid water cooling solution for this to really get the best out of it.  I'm not sure a air cooled option will do you any good, but hey I've been wrong many times, so there might be something that can handle the job.All in all, not bad, but it's not going to give you much performance boost over last gen, matter of fact I found out later 13700k beats it in a lot of tests, blargh!

Running air cooled on DeepCool Assassin IV with ease",03-11-2023,"So far so good.  This CPU is a monster and runs very nicely and boosts to max clocks (6ghz on two cores and 5.7ghz on all cores) unlimited TDP settings but thermally limited at 90c with -60mV offset.  I have noticed that it runs a bit cooler than my previous 13900KF, especially when you consider the core to core deltas.  I use my PC mostly for gaming and encoding, so as long as you have a great case with plenty of air flow and a top notch cooler, you can easily run it air cooled without issues as it will just throttle itself when it hits whatever thermal maximum you set in the UEFI BIOS.In gaming workloads it never throttles though and stays at 5.7ghz all core boost the entire time with temps in CPU intensive games anywhere from the upper 50s to mid 60s and upper 40s to mid 50s in non CPU intensive games**Update**I have the CPU now at 5.8ghz with HT disabled and a -75mV offset and it's working like a charm and very stable in gaming workloads and encoding (it downclocks when it hits 90c for encoding workloads but for gaming it stays at 5.8ghz), which is amazing since it's on an air cooled setup, though the setup is as optimal as it gets for air cooling!  As for temps, they are a little lower than running it at 5.7ghz with HT enabled and a -50mV offset.  If I use a -75mV offset with 5.8ghz and HT enabled, my PC crashes.  So disabling HT definitely enables the CPU to use less power.If you're predominantly using your machine for gaming, then I definitely recommend turning HT off regardless as most games tend to run better with HT disabled.  But if you're using it for productivity or a blend of both productivity and gaming, then definitely turn HT on.The only mildly disappointing thing for me is that the memory controller isn't as good as I thought it would be.  Mine runs 48GB DDR5 7400 CL34 at 1.35V on the IMC, but to hit DDR5 7600 CL36 with stability I need to increase the IMC voltage to 1.41V which just isn't worth it if you ask me for such a minor bump in performance.  My previous 13900KF could do 48GB DDR5 7800 at 1.36V on the IMC.Core wise though, the CPU is definitely superior to 13th gen."

Much faster than my previous i7-6850k",19-03-2024,"So I finally upgraded my home workstation, and went to this new i9-14900K. It is incredibly fast. I had a Davinci Resolve video project file that I rendered on my old setup, the i7-6850K and it took just over 22 minutes to complete the render. On the new i9, the exact same file was re exported, took just over 8 minutes..! almost a 3x speed increase.! Also, when you speed up footage in Resolve, the old cpu could not play it back smoothly, it would jump and chug like crazy, the new i9, it plays it back sped up 800% no problems and I can actually see how it looks without having to export the entire video clip to see it playback the retimed footage smoothly. Applications open u p much faster too, but that could be more due to the pcie4.0 nvme system drive that is much faster than the previous version nvme I had in the old build. The one thing I do not like about the new cpu, is the number of pci lanes. You only get 20, 16 are pcie5.0 and 4 are pcie4.0. This wont be an issue for most people, but my old cpu had 40 lanes, allowing me to run 3 GPU's at the same time, and YES, I needed them, I use GPU rendering software that can use up to 8 GPU's in one system on one license and every additional GPU speeds up your render times a lot when rendering out 3D sims. With this new cpu, I can only run 2 GPU's and they run at 8x, cause they share the 16x, and that does leave me 4 full pcie4.0 lanes for the system drive. It is not a deal breaker, and the increased speed overall is well worth it. One thing EVERYBODY should be aware of, is these new intel chips have P cores and E cores. Something my old cpu did NOT have. E-cores can severely impact certain software performance. When I booted up the new machine and tried my Ableton DAW  for the first time, I was expecting to be so happy with a performance boost, and the software was literally almost unusable.! The E-cores were slowing the software down so bad, I could barely change settings in the preferences.! It was that bad. I had to install process lasso ( fantastic software that is free if you have never heard of it ) and disable the use of E-cores for Ableton and then it worked very fast and is great.!"

Powerful but Warm",08-05-2024,"Before you purchase this CPU please also purchase alongside of it purchase a 360 AiO as well, this CPU is in need of it. I'm not trying to say that to scare you but it runs warm. In my (asus) bios I turned on ""Disabled-Enforce all limits"" so that the motherboard doesn't try to do on the fly OC to keep temps low and stability up. I haven't had any crashes or stability issues at all. I did a full platform upgrade from the 10900k to this, I kept my RTX 3080 and the performance bump was actually fully noticeable. I'd say my average temperature for doing basic computing is around 37c with my Lian Li Galahad II Trinity 360.

i7-14700K is a significant improvement from i9-12900K",31-05-2024,"I decided the difference between the i7 and the i9 didn't justify the price difference, considering I was already getting about 1/3 more performance than my 12th generation i9. I wanted plenty of motherboard resources so I also bought the MSI MEG Z790 ACE, 32 GB of Kingston Fury 6400MT/s DDR5 and a 2TB Samsung 990 NVMe drive.Cooling had been a slight issue with the 12th generation i9, even with a 360mm AIO cooler, so I went custom loop. Along the way I found a GPU water cooler on sale and decided to install a lot of cooling. The Thermaltake 900 tower can take two 560mm radiators, but I wanted some disks, so I went for a 560x140 and a 280x140, both 45mm thick and backed by 6 fans. Four more fans feed air into the case and there's till plenty of clear space for more air to be dragged in.So what's the result? The processor runs at 85C worst case, and only two cores at that temperature. The fast DDR5 does make a significant difference. I initially ran it at 6GT/s then turned it up to 6.2 and finally 6.4. The last change is a 3.5% change in DDR5 speed and that gave me a 2.4% increase in system speed. I kept my old RTX3070 which used to run over 80C and now runs at 62C worst case. So despite more performance the system runs a lot cooler.I mostly run X-Plane 12, which runs the GPU and CPU very hard, continuously. After several hours the cooling water reached 36C and the worst core temperature was 85C. The processor just works. No stability issues with the standard settings on the MSI Z690 motherboard. There are three standard memory tuning options for 6.0, 6.2, and 6.4 GT/s and all work. This will do for me for a few years."

Insane performance at a cost",02-06-2024,"This processor is a speed demon. Gaming, editing, encoding, and whatever else you can think of, it can handle. The performance is there. The value for money is quite good too. Unless you really want top of the line, this chip effectively eliminates the i9 from consideration. 20 cores. 8P and 12E. Boost up to 5.6GHz on 2 threads. I swapped a 12600K for this part and I'm still kinda staggered at just how fast it is in heavily threaded apps. This is a perfect upgrade chip for somebody on an older 12th gen i5 or lower. I wouldn't consider building new with it however.There's a cost to this CPU though. Heat. And power draw. I have an Arctic Liquid Freezer III 360 AIO on this chip, and even with a sizable undervolt, it still throttles at around 230W running 100C. It feels like this chip is almost uncoolable. Unless you go full custom liquid cooling or something. I considered a large air cooler for this chip and I'm glad I went with an AIO. Buyer beware. This thing runs hot. It's also incredibly fast. If you can cool it this thing will fly."

Fast, but unstable when overclocked.",11-01-2024,"I built 3 systems using 14900 series. They all had serious stability problems when in use.  After researching for weeks and reinstalling OS with no better result.  I finally disabled overclocking ""AI overclocking"", which was running as high as 1.6v.  I also found a BIOS setting after running some tools and set it INTEL FAIL SAFE.  this allowed me to run the AVX2 stress test successfully.  It basically throttles the chip.I can't tell you the frustration this caused figuring this out.  Everything from chrome browsers to Adobe CS would crash randomly for no apparent reason every few minutes while all ""tests"" showed it was fine.  I lowered my refresh rate to 60 from 120, killed AI overclocking and set the INTEL setting and now have a very stable system. It outperforms my 5950x when encoding, which is impressive.  It does run HOT even with water cooling.  IF I had it to do over again, I would avoid 13000 and 14000 chips as there is a OODLE issue as well when it comes to gaming with Unreal 5.  Basically an unfixable hardware flaw that affects some chips.Here's the thing, you will not notice a difference as nothing I use with the exception of HANDBRAKE, ever comes close to maxing out the chip when in use.  Adobe CS uses my 3080ti and the intel quicksync iGPU simultaneously which rarely went above 40%, and usually was around 15-20 when editing.  HW encodes for HD were at 350fps, software, 250, intel 300.  So a small advantage in Adobe CS is why I went with the 14900K vs KF.System was using ""AI overclocking"" pushing it to 6.2 roughly single core.  Disabled in BIOS now.Specs: Asus z290a Wifi II, Corsair 96GB DDR5 5600, Samsung 990 Pro, CPU Water cooled, 3080tiSo the ""K"" is basically useless for me at this point and don't see myself doing it manually as it's just not worth it to me.  That said, when stable, it's a very capable chip."

6.2GHZ 8200mts cl38 Daily Driver.",04-04-2024,"This professional CPU isn't designed for the average user. However, if you're a tinkerer at heart, eager to dive deeper than the surface-level information often presented in YouTube ""videos"" (or should we say, commercials), this is unquestionably for you. I've acquired multiple units for various builds/configurations from a wide array of retailersâBest Buy, Newegg, and others included.For those considering making a purchase, I highly recommend using an Apex/Apex Encore MOBO or another reputable 2 DIMM board, particularly for AM5 or LGA1700, if overclocking is your goal. A high-quality cooler is crucial; for those opting for an AIO, ensure it includes at least an 8th gen Asetek pump and a 360 Thickboy copper radiator with performance fansâAvoid the aesthetically pleasing but functionally inferior Lian Li reversed SL Infinity Fans. Genuine static pressure fans, capable of efficiently doing the job, are what you need. Despite what your favorite YouTuber might suggest, you should prioritize efficiency over aesthetics.When selecting DDR5, opt for GOOD BINNED options. If a high-binned QVL compatible set isn't your choice, at a minimum, go for HYNIX A for single rank and HYNIX M for dual rank.The 14900K, when expertly tuned, becomes a gaming and multitasking powerhouseâachieving 43 to 44k in R23, with 6.2GHz boosting, 5.9GHz across its 8 physical cores and 8 threads, and 16 physical e-cores at 4.7GHz for a total of 32 threads, of which only 8 are virtual. With hyper-threading and e-cores enabled, it supports 8200 to 8400 MTS CL38 DDR5 RAM, boasts sub-55ns bus latency, and sub-9.3ns FWL. It's a marvel in Aida64 full, minus SSD, burn-in stress test stability. Adjusting all cores down to 5.8 and boosting to 6.0 can further reduce bus latency to easily below 50ns...Did I mention overall CPU temperatures typically remain between 35 to 40Â°C under heavy gaming loads, rarely exceeding 50Â°C? Despite the capability of 3 EATX connections to easily deliver over 400W of power, I'd advise against exceeding 325W daily, as the performance gains beyond this point are minimal without extreme overclocking and cooling methodsâincreased voltage requirements could significantly shorten the lifespan of your CPU. For tinkerers, this CPU is a dream come true.As of this dateâ4-4-2024: We anticipate future silicon manufacturing constraints will evolve, but that's a discussion for another time.The X3D Elephant in the room: Don't worry, I own one, and this is about science, not purchase bias...We'll sidestep intricate discussions about CLDO, FCLK, and MCLK concerns, and why the substantial L3 cache has become an essential workaround for the instability caused by chiplet-based IMC in handling DDR5 for gamers. If the augmentation of the L3 cache wasn't primarily to address DDR5 issues stemming from the chiplet design, why not significantly enhance and accelerate the L1 cache? The design doesn't allow for it since it's not monolithic, which wouldn't be practical. Those well-versed in the subject matter understand this. While chiplets represent the future, we must acknowledge that this future hasn't fully materialized for every aspect of computing, allowing us to look beyond the ""normie YouTuber AMD cults.""Indeed, I own a 7800X3D build and absolutely adore it! It excels in gaming... primarily in GAMING! Thus, there's no cause for concern. Let's briefly touch on the ""benefits"" like reduced thermals and supposed platform longevity (as if motherboard chipset upgrades and advancements in power delivery methods don't occur... humor me, over the planned 6 years). I, too, long for Z390 features on my Z790 board (/end sarcasm), not to mention the potential for longer boot times when tinkering with DDR5 or PBO, or even under normal conditions, and texture stutter/tearing... oops, and all those other delightful topics Lisa tends to highlight without addressing the influence of influencers with communications degrees rather than computer science degrees.  Just having fun, do what you love!I don't blame Amazon, Intel, AMD, or Nvidia more than the other. Manufacturing and shipping issues happen. The chip I received from Amazon didn't meet my expectations, but my other purchases have been exceptional. By chance alone, the other four 14900Ks I've received from various distributors have been stellar!Note:Settings in pictures are daily driven....No stability concerns all AIDIA 64 Stress tested for multiple hours and hundreds of gaming/workload hours.  I can get bus latency down to under 50NS but need to decrease core clock to locked 5.8GHZ to stay at safe voltage....  Depends what needs done, either/or is screaming fast even 55ns at that Bandwidth."

IF YOU WANT THE AIR COOLED OPTION",11-02-2024,"I'm not going to go over the same performance reviews others have done, yes its very fast for only $550 its the king of the poor mans build PC. my last PC its replacing was a $1000 10980xe and looking at the numbers the 14900k in average is 70-77% faster than the 10980xe. the only disadvantage between the 2 was the 10980xe had 48 PCIe lanes and ran 32c to 56c hot.i can't say the same about the 14900k heat, its spreader is almost half of the 10980xe. you can't just simply add a stock cooler or a ""MC'watercooler"" and expect the problem will solve itself. this is the first CPU in my 26 yrs of building PC's you have to plan out your cooler set up.ever since a 2012 water leak from these Mc'watercoolers (all in one 2 fan radiator kits sold by name brands) Ive never trusted them cost me $1500 in damages. The only water coolers that don't leak for me were the ones i built but water cooling is expensive and you have to inspect them at least every 3 months for debris in the tank or leaks. with air i only have to clean the pc 2x a year.yes you can control temps with an air cooler, and get the same temps as a 3 fan radiator water cooler. I'll post the results without adding a watt limit in the mobo post screen.here is the parts i bought to air cool running the new cinabench 2024 for 30 mins i can get max performance on a defualt non OC not hitting above 99C on the P cores1. Noctua NH-D15 chromax.Black | Dual-Tower CPU Cooler | 140mm | Black2. Noctua NF-A15 HS-PWM chromax.Black.swap (this adds a 3rd fan for the air cooler you'll need it)3. FDXGYH 4 Pcs CPU Heatsink Fan Buckle PC Mainboard CPU Radiator Fan 12CM Wire Buckle Upper Hook Type Fixing Clip  (these buckles are compatible with noctus 140mm fans)4. Easycargo 40mm Heatsink Kit 40mmx40mmx20mm (this you place on the flat base of the noctua cooler will help dissipate heat)5. Easycargo 100pcs Heatsink Assortment Kit Small Cooler Aluminum Heat (these you throw on the back of your mobo on and around the mount brackets you'll me amazed how adding heat sinks on the back of the mobo will reduce temps)6. Thermal Grizzly Kryonaut (this is the best thermal grease cooler by 1-2c cooler than artic silver mx 6)7. Thermalright Intel 12th/13th Generation LGA1700 Anti-Bending Buckle ( a must add a little thermal grease on the cpu side flaps this buckle is 100% aluminum will al help dissipate heat.then i went to my mother board software options (mobo is an MSI MEG Z790 ACE MAX) select ""CPU cooler tuning"" select ""tower air cooling"" which will limit the wattage draw to under 300w also note if you are not using a Water Cooling Reservoir  you should also use this option, water cooling a 14900k and OC really does require a reservoir, and a 4x 120 fan size radiator if you're simply using a pre-built 2x fan radiator its not enough to handle the 14900k and the CPU is known for drawing 370w plus!!so using air cooled i got a 2371 score with no watt limiter option an temps were 78-100c on the p cores, and with the 300 watt limit the score was  2328 with temps 70-99c never hit 100c case the limiter would kick in. (note this is from CPU testing that punishes the CPU realistically i don't see this CPU going over 88c even on the most demanding game in 3 years.i personally do not recommend OC this CPU its already been pushed to its limits by INTEL at best for another 100 watts when all you're getting is 3-4 more FPS and that's not worth it. and all these people bragging a 6.2-6.5ghz OC, there just flexing for clout, then they take the CPU back to default. i already have my P cores spiking to 6.002 at 288-300 watts, and under 99c temps; adding 0.198mhz will meaning nothing for apps and gaming.personal note the MSI MEG Z790 ACE MAX Gaming Motherboard is absolutely amazing at squeezing out all the performance of the 14900k worth the $700 price never crashed during testing that 26 power phases is godly  compared to my last gen EVGA x299 dark had 12 phase...RIP EGA :("

I MADE IT WORK",22-05-2024,This is something that a lot of people do not understand about processors. If you put too much voltage you are going to damage it. I want to delid it but I don't see the need and here is whyEven if I can get it 20 degrees cooler it will not matter It will still need 3.5 to 4.2 volts to stay stable at advertised speeds.I am running it @ 5.4 GHZ all P cores and this thing is unbelievably reliable . And maybe 10 seconds extra to render vs 5.7 to 6.0 GHZI get the point that ppl want to have the Bragging rights to say that it runs that fast but it will gwt damaged guaranteed 400 watts is a lot for that little unit. I think that 5.4 5.3 5.2 is more than enough specially when you have a total of 32 threads and gaming is practically single threaded . And most games are GPU bound. I only use it in the gaming department for Flight simulator and have not seen it above 68 degrees.I had a 4770 k and still running strong at 4.5 GHZ in a very small case.Intel is a beast and this I 9 is very good . Future proof for at least 5 years to come .Note. I have delided at least 20 cpus and the ones that got damaged were the ones that got a lot of voltage . They are very heat resistant but voltage just kills them .I have been running this cpu 24 /7 not an issueNot a blue screenJust underclock and undervolt and you are good to go This thing is a monster .

This is a good processor, but remember it has E and P cores so thats annoying to find out later.",23-06-2024,"This is a nice processor that I use in a dev box.  I have it air cooled and can play Minecraft with shaders all day on it with my 4080GTX and 128 gigs of memory.  The only issue I have is probably my own fault, in that I learned that intel did that stunt where they introduced P and E cores.  I'm not sure if they are making straight performance core models by the time I write this but if you are a rabid gamer make sure you are getting that type of proc and not this proc.  Still, this proc will do just fine for me as I use this for hyper-v and development work.  I'm sure it will play all the latest games just fine. and If it doesn't I can just pop in a different proc."

Main improvement is lower power cost day-day",03-05-2024,"I upgraded from an 8700k to this 14700k nearly 8 years later. Performance-wise, the difference is fairly negligible to me, and that is reflected in the 'real' specs. Going from 6 cores to 20 cores isnt really a 3x+ increase when most of those cores are 'efficiency cores'. User benchmark puts 14700k as only being 47% faster than the 8700k, despite being 8 years and 6 generations apart.The main improvement from my point of view is the reduced idle/casual power use. My UPS tells me that for my 8700k/1070ti system I drew ~0.43 Kw, and my new 14700k/4070ti super draws ~0.31 Kw watching YT, browsing the web (includes fans, monitors, etc).Mostly just wanted more balance for the new graphics card, since that's what does most of the heavy lifting these days anyway.

Possibly better memory support than i9-13900K",05-04-2024,"Once they came down in price, I did get a i9-14900K as an ""upgrade"" from a i9-13900KF to  i9-14900K .  It's OK but I can't rave over it.  It is more of an sideways change rather than an upgrade.The i9-14900K is fast but not more so that a i9-13900K.  For me, the Cinebench R23 scores are about the same for 13th versus 14th gen.  Though the i9-14900K appears to run DDR5 more stably and at higher frequencies than the i9-13900K.  Also, the i9-14900K is enabled for XTU AI enable tuning in XTU but it's not that helpful.  I even wonder if it is worth getting a K at all, these CPU's are plenty fast for gaming without overclocking.I did NOT notice a significant improvement in the operating temperatures.  Maybe a slight improvement but I did flush out the cooling system and clean out the water block so I am doubtful that the running temps are better.  Also, I suggest that you NOT let these chips get anywhere near TjMax (100C).  I had one i9-13900KF literally fail due to allowing it to get to TjMax frequently when stress testing.  A second one became slightly flaky.I thought the built in ARC display support of the K version might be helpful since I intended to devote the graphics card to the gaming monitor and use the built-in ARC on a side display.  But as it turns out, it wasn't worth it for me.  If you are gaming with this level of processor, you really need a comparable graphics card but most of them will drive four displays.  IMO, you are better off getting a KF and spending the money so saved on better graphics card.The original asking price was insane, I bought it on a whim on a late night.  On the morning morning after, I had buyers remorse, tried to cancel but could not, so instead, I refused the package.  It took literally 6 months to get a refund.  That was rather irksome."

It's the perfect fit for this monster PC I just built.",07-12-2023,"A lot of people are upset with the 14900k because of the minimal performance leap thar came between it and the 13900k. I say who cares. If you have a 13900k, don't upgrade, but if you have an older PC or 12th Gen, this is a worthy upgrade. I absolutely love mine. It's a monster of a CPU.I honestly don't recommend air cooling it. It can get pretty hot and there are only a small handful of air coolers that can handle this 14900k without setting power limits (which most people don't know how to do, let alone even know what that means)If you're not doing a custom water loop to cool your 14900k, I recommend you do what I've done to cool mine, you dont neeeed to, but it helps. I have an AIO (All-In-One Cooler) and I setup a push-pull configuration on my radiator. That means I have 3 fans on the bottom blowing in through the radiator, and 3 more fans blowing up and out of the case. Both are blowing upward. It creates more airflow. One side is pushing the air, the other side is helping pull that air through. Then I got a thermalright contact frame. Any LGA 1700 contact frame should work but the thermalright version is cheap. It might say 12th/13th Gen but it will also work on 14th Gen. So get an AIO, setup a push-pull fan configuration and get a contact frame. It's helping my Temps significantly. I typically stay in the high 50's or low 60's during 4K gaming. This CPU draws a ton of power so you might see it bump up to 80â° occasionally, for a very brief moment. (Maybe 1 second or less)"

Please note that the F in the 14700KF means NO iGPU",24-02-2024,"Wanted to purchase the unlocked version of the 20 core 14th gen processor and saw that this was a cheaper option at the time. All the description says is that ""Discrete graphics is required."" It would be much more helpful by adding a line that says the F version stands for no integrated graphics card. If you're doing any kind of workstation work such as video editing, most software will take advantage of the processor having an iGPU as well and so I'm actually losing performance with this model version. I'll have to return the item to purchase the correct version without an F. I would give it a full 5 stars if it had the line explaining the F version."

Scores well with cinebench",05-04-2024,Like the idea of no onboard video heating up the processor.  The irony is i have a Asus pro art MB 750 model that does the integration of components. My station is primarily used as a work station though it scores well with PC Mark 10 and cinebench. 3D Mark declares the obvious that I need to upgrade my video card from several years ago. The ai over clocking helps in the bench marking significantly. Lot easier to overclock than in the early 2000's on my core 2quad.

So far so good.",22-10-2023,"Sorta came from a 13900k but I gave that to a relative after their x299/i9-7940x system began to have issues. He bought a z790 board and was amazed how far ahead the 13900k is in comparison an overclocked Skylake-X processor. He fixed the issue with the x299 system, but he decided to stay with Raptor Lake. All of which is okay by me because that old 13900k had no overclocking headroom, and I could only undervolt it by 5mv before it became unstable. I was going to buy another 13900k or maybe the ks version, but I decided to wait for the 14900k.The 14900k I got on the other hand has some overclocking headroom. I already set all P-cores to 5.8GHz, while keeping the double-core Turbo Boost at 6.0GHz. I also set the cache to 5.2Ghz and it's completely stable. I was not able to raise the multiplier at all with my 13900k. Just happy my 14900k isn't a lottery loser.While the clock of both the 13900ks and 14900k are the same, the 13900ks has a cherry picked memory controller. If you're looking to do a ton of RAM overclocking then the 13900ks may be the way to go.... but that's not to say if you'd get a 14900k with a good memory controller. Both my 13900k and 14900k work with DDR5-7200 RAM with XMP set, and no adjustments to the memory controller voltages.If you're buying the 14900k off the get-go and building a new system around it, then I recommend pairing it with a motherboard that has the BIOS Flashback feature."

A Monster CPU with One Major Caveat",20-10-2023,"I built PC with the new Intel i9-14900k, and I must say, it's a beast of a processor. Coming from an i7-8700k, the performance boost is nothing short of incredible. Multitasking, gaming, and content creation have all seen a significant improvement. Multithreaded applications and gaming experiences run smoother.  It's a productivity powerhouse. The clock speeds are no slouch either, making it excellent for single-threaded tasks and gaming. The major downside of this CPU is the heat it generates. Even with a high-end cooling solution, it tends to run hot, and that's something you must take into consideration when setting up your cooling solution. Be ready for this CPU to draw a significant amount of power at full load. It can put quite a load on your power supply and might necessitate an upgrade if you're not already prepared. The Intel i9-14900k is an incredible processor, and the upgrade from an i7-8700k is substantial. Its exceptional performance in various tasks justifies its price tag. If you're willing to address these challenges, you'll be rewarded with a fantastic computing experience."

Despite it bottlenecking against my 2080 Ti, it still ran cool under a 360mm CLC, topping out at no more than 51 degrees C gaming (GPU load) and 60 degrees under full CPU loads. But since the current market for new components is pretty good, I opted to go all in on a 13th gen build rather than find a better X99 motherboard.Odds are, you're probably going to be cross shopping the i5-13600K with the i7-13700K and the i9-13900K. Unless your workflow necessitates the additional core count or you're chasing records, the performance difference between those CPUs and the 13600K did not seem worth the hundreds of dollars of additional cost and the massive increase in peak power consumption. Power also equals heat, and that was another motivating factor for going with the 13600K, having been accustomed to a relatively cool and quiet build for some time. That said; with the additional cores and much higher boost frequency, I was expecting higher peak power draw and temps despite a lower TDP on paper.And they were definitely higher, under the same 360mm CLC. After running benchmarks with Cinebench and 3DMark, I was hitting peak temps in the mid-to-high 70s under full CPU loads. Gaming loads however were definitely more manageable though, sitting in the 40s and seldom breaking 50 degrees, which was actually a small but appreciable improvement over the 5960X. I'd advise at minimum a high quality air cooler or a 240mm CLC for this processor.The out of the box performance is something else though. I managed to hit 23345 on a multi-core Cinebench test and a 16459 combined score on 3DMark Time Spy. Again, this is stock clocks paired with an overclocked 2080 Ti and 32GB of DDR5 at 5600 MHz. At 3440 x 1440 and 144Hz, games run like butter. I could dabble in overclocking it since I have the headroom but honestly, I don't see the point. It's fantastic as is.All in all, I feel like the 13600K is kind of the no-brainer option for most people looking to put together a high-end system on a budget. You're getting most of the performance of it's more expensive stablemates for a much lower price and less obnoxiously high power and cooling requirements. The KF is also a little cheaper if you don't need integrated graphics. Just buy it. You'll love it."

Amazing underrated cpu",01-06-2024,"Been using this cpu for about a year now and it's amazing. For every game I play, some of which are known to be cpu intnesive, it has only gotten up to about 30% usage. Sure it is not a cheap cpu, but it definetly has the processing power despite being an i5. Even when I have stress tested it to 100% usage, it still easily stays cool with a vetroo v5 cooler. Plus you can brag to people that your cpu has 14 cores and 20 logical processors. great cpu, would recommend"

Coming from i5 12400f",11-04-2024,"I was on the fence about upgrading from i5 12400f, which is a beast of a cpu. Some pros and cons.  My specs: RTX 4070ti,  z790 ddr5 gigabyte mobo, 32 gb fury ram, 1tb WD black SSD gen 4.Pros:More coresNoticeably faster in some areas like booting and some applications.Some triple A GPU bound games will get a noticeable FPS boost. (Not huge, talking 3-10 at most).CPU bound games (emulators for me) will get much better stability and cpu usage reduction.Cons:If you are looking for energy efficiency these 13th gen and higher chips are NOT it. More cores means more energy draw for sure. On Triple A games the chip is using 20-30 watts more electricity. In emulators like RPCS3 itâs nearly double. I went from 30- 40 watt average to average 80 and in some instances spiked above 100. The good thing is emulators are much less GPU bound so the wattage balances out, sort of.Heat- Iâm running an AIO lian li 360 Galahad, with the 12400f I was nearly always running at room temp (my house gets lots of shade and stays cool/cold) so I was used to 22c range. With the 13600k you  will see a 10 degree increase even at idle. Emulators will get into the 60s while triple A games 40s and 50s. With the 12400f my fan curve rarely ever triggered high fan speeds. With the 13th gen you will definitely hear those fans work at load.Side notes I tried the 13600k on two mobos (z790 and 690) you can use it on older 690 compatible mobos, you just need to flash bios to latest. It was super easy on the gigabyte z790 and 690 mobo.Overall. The performance jump is noticeable in some games. But far more noticeable is the increase in heat and wattage usage. If you have a 12th gen and are on the fence you really donât need to upgrade, however depending on what you are doing with it could be the main factor. I wanted my RPCS3 to run at 60fps in 4k constantly and the 13600k did the trick.  (playing MGS4 guns of the patriots in 4k and stable is unreal!)"

powerful but runs hot",28-08-2023,"this i5-kf replaces my 11th gen i7-kf. sure, one reads that and first thought is, he's downgrading. well, hang on, grasshopper!! this pup puts the 11th gen i7 to shame even when it was slightly overclocked. very weird cause it's has a slower speed but when it's time to rock & roll, it flies.boot time, and app loading is measurably quicker. when stress/load tested using the intel tool, it gets very hot. with this processor, temps above 89c did not cause throttling, so intel must be ok with this. temps are considerably lower when not testing. i was ready to buy an aio cooler but am holding off for now. the huge noctua d15 attached may suffice. i don't want to mess around with water pumps, so until intel figures out how to bring the heat, with less heat, i can park here for the foreseeable.lemme go out on a limb and say that for most folks, this much hp may be overkill. lastly, this was not a ""vine"" purchase but a damn good one at $285!"

13600kf is the king of budget gaming",08-11-2023,"I bought 2 of these to put in mine and my wifes builds, both work perfect and dominate every game on the market, including Tarkov which if you play you know the struggle with CPU on that game. My wifes runs bone stock with a NZXT Kraken 280mm and stays idle at about 29c and around 55c when gaming. Mine on the other hand is on a Vetro 360 aio and is overclocked to 5.6ghz all core stable and can get quite warm. Reaching 80-88c at times. Running mine at stock speed drops it to about 55c during gaming as well. I got mine to a 5.7ghz stable but started hitting TJmax so i undervolted and clocked down to 5.6ghz and runs fine. I have a friend who went with the 13900k and hes only netting 10-12 more fps than my OCed 13600k. Compared to the rest of the 13/14 gen CPUs the price to performance of the 13600k is unbeatable at the moment."

It works",23-07-2023,"I bought this processor based on the recommendation that it's the go-to mid/upper-mid range for this generation. I didn't do any in-depth comparisons for cost to speed, etc. as I felt it unnecessary. I'm coming from a 2014 Intel i7, so pretty much anything is going to be an upgrade. Everything is working great. Air-cooled with a deepcool AK620, the temps under prime95 load can reach 100c, which seems extremely hot, but it seems like that's just the way the cookie crumbles with my setup. Reapplied thermal paste and made some space in my tower for better airflow and it more or less remained the same. Idle temps are around 35c.Everything is running very snappily, particularly loading models in Stable Diffusion now takes only seconds when it used to take minutes with my 4790k.

Honest review for 13600KF",31-01-2023,"I have no idea why people are praising this CPU. It is a power hog, when I load something I literally see my computer slowing down for 13600k to power up. It is constantly thermal throttling to the point of blue screen of death, even though I am using it with 240 Thermaltake GlacierOne liquid cooler on a higher end Z790 board. 13600k is very unstable and absolutely requires 360 liquid cooler to handle it, even at stock speed. Sure, I can limit it and it will not affect gaming or I can turn off E-cores, but what is the point of spending so much more money then? I had an excellent experience with 12400F, no stability issues, perfect temperatures all the time. I may go back to 12400F or get 13400F, I am definitely not keeping 13600kf.In order to get a full potential of 13600k you need RTX 4090. I have a brand new RTX 4080 and it is used at 100% while playing Cyberpunk 2077, CPU was showing only at 70%. Save money and get 13400F instead or wait until 14th gen comes out later this year."

The K igpu is worth more than the $30 price difference",26-03-2023,"The 13600k foundation is without doubt a great cpu.  But, even if you have a beefy GPU on hand, spend the extra $30 and get the K version with onboard GPUâ¦. Beyond making non booting systems easier to troubleshoot, it turns out that Intelâs QuickSync encoder/decoders offer benefits that even the top range NVIDIA cards do not offer.  Apps like DiVinci or Adobe Premiere can utilize Intelâs QuickSync in addition to NVIDIA transcoders, making the K cpu significantly faster in those use cases.Granted that in gaming cases the K and KF provide the same performance - but if you ever need the encoding options in the future, youâll miss them.The K series will retain the $30 premium later on the used market when the time comes, so why not invest in the most options you can right now?"

Saving money on the CPU allowed me to allocate more money to other components that would have had a greater impact on overall performance. I donât regret skipping a more costly CPU. This gets the job done and at a cost that seems unreasonably low for what you getâ¦but definitely not complaining!!! If you want to spend more money on components like a better GPU (got the 4090) and upgraded RAM this is a great way to save a bit of money without sacrificing much in the way of performance.

Sam,,Great Upgrade,13-01-2024,"Upgrading to the Intel Core i5-13600KF Desktop Processor from my Ryzen 5800X3D has been a game-changer for my computing experience. This powerhouse of a processor, with its 14 cores (6 P-cores and 8 E-cores) and a substantial 24M cache, has significantly enhanced the performance of my system. The ability of this CPU to turbo up to 5.1 GHz is particularly impressive, contributing to a remarkable improvement in processing speed and overall system responsiveness. Whether I'm running demanding applications, engaging in high-end gaming, or juggling multiple tasks simultaneously, the i5-13600KF handles it all with an ease that is immediately noticeable. The efficiency and speed are especially evident in CPU-intensive tasks, where this processor clearly outshines its predecessor.Beyond just raw performance, what I appreciate about the Intel Core i5-13600KF is its balance between power and efficiency. The division of Performance-cores and Efficiency-cores means that it smartly allocates resources based on the task at hand, ensuring optimal performance without unnecessary power consumption. This aspect is crucial for a balanced system that's powerful yet not overly taxing on energy use. The upgrade process itself was straightforward, and the compatibility with a wide range of motherboards and hardware made the transition smooth. In terms of gaming, the difference is palpable, with smoother frame rates and faster loading times. For creative tasks like video editing and 3D rendering, the performance boost has been equally beneficial, noticeably reducing the time spent on rendering and processing. All in all, the Intel Core i5-13600KF has proven to be an excellent upgrade from the Ryzen 5800X3D, offering a superb blend of performance, efficiency, and versatility. It's a 5-star processor that I'd highly recommend to anyone looking to upgrade their system for an enhanced computing experience."

The processor also runs surprisingly cool, even under heavy load.",28-04-2023,"The media could not be loaded.

I recently got my hands on the Intel Core i9-12900K Desktop Processor, and I have to say, I am blown away by its performance. This processor is an absolute powerhouse, with 16 cores (8P+8E) and speeds of up to 5.2 GHz. It's also unlocked, which means I can push its limits even further if I want to.Installing the processor was easy enough, although I did have to make sure my motherboard was compatible with the LGA1700 socket and 600 series chipset. Once I had everything set up, I fired up my favorite games and applications to see how the processor would perform.The results were nothing short of impressive. The i9-12900K chewed through every task I threw at it with ease, from demanding video editing software to the latest AAA games. I was able to multitask without any lag or slowdowns, and my system felt incredibly responsive and snappy.The processor also runs surprisingly cool, even under heavy load. I did notice a slight increase in power consumption compared to my old processor, but it's a small price to pay for the sheer performance boost.Overall, I am extremely satisfied with the Intel Core i9-12900K Desktop Processor. If you're a power user or a gamer who demands the best performance, this processor is definitely worth considering. It's not cheap, but in my opinion, it's worth every penny for the sheer power and speed it delivers."

Insanely Powerful at The Cost of High Thermal/Power",27-04-2022,"My primary use case for the 12900k is gaming and encoding video. Personally I could justify the higher price tag over the competing i5 and i7 because of my specific use case.Good Things:The processor is absolutely and insanely powerful. I am encoding 1080, 30fps video roughly 50% to 80% faster give or take than my previous processor which was a 11700kf! One single generation and an i9 upgrade has saved me astronomical amounts of time. As far as gaming goesâ¦ I would say is more heavily reliant on a graphics card so I wonât go into much detail on that. Overall this processor is wonderful and deserves its 5 stars.Not so good things:I didnât take a star off for this because it isnât really a problem rather just the way the processor is designed.It uses a metric ton of power, Iâm talking 241 watts during my normal video encoding sessions. Which in turn generates a space heater worth of heat. One of those things âgreat power comes great responsibilityâ. I am telling you this because you NEED TO HAVE AN INCREDIBLE COOLER. I am currently using a Noctua NH-D15 and itâs okay. I would recommend it to anyone that prefers air cooling but nothing less. If you choose a cooler that is less you will regret it. I would venture to say you need the cooler I have mentioned or 280mm and above AIO to even keep it from thermal throttling at heavy load. Do not underestimates this, gaming it is much more tame, still running high temperatures but better. I still would get a really great CPU Cooler or otherwise you WILL be thermal throttling like crazy.Overall this is a great CPU and although not worth it for some, can be a great processor if it is worth it. Just beware of the watts and heat. I was dumbfounded."

Not necessary for everyone",11-05-2023,"This isn't the processor for everyone, but it is very fast. The individual cores aren't significantly different from those in the 13th generation i7. But if you have a need for a lot of parallel processing then this may be the processor for you. I do software development, which it doesn't help 99% of the time, gaming, which it helps a little, and occasionally transcoding large amounts of video and music. During transcoding it helps a huge amount. I have over 300GB of FLAC audio files that I ripped from my CD collection, I never buy mp3s. I wanted to have that on my phone, but I didn't want to carry it at full rate because I can't tell the difference in the car, so I transcoded it. I had done that once before and it took more than a day on a five year old Ryzen 7. This machine took around 30 minutes. 30-40 times faster. At work the optics team, which uses ray tracing software to design optical telescopes and laser focusing lenses, uses i9s in preference to Xeons. The Xeons might be faster under some circumstances, but the machines are hugely expensive, so the i9s are much better for price performance. Would I buy it again? I'd probably buy the 13th generation, but if I had any sense I'd just get the 13th gen i7."

Amazing core from Intel!",08-07-2024,"I love this core. Runs heavy hitting games like Cyberpunk great, and low power games such as visual novels with ease. In terms of power use, it's not the most efficient, but you ARE getting a lot. Same with heat, I chose to use a 360mm aio cooler to mitigate any temperature issues, and it has worked great in keeping this heat beast cool.Core wise you get 8 performance cores and 8 efficiency cores. As long as it's teamed up with a operating system built for hybrid cores like Win 11, you should be fine; this goes for all Intel 12 generation cores.In conclusion, runs hot, but is a beast. FULLY recommended for the enthusiast."

Put a minor overclock to 5.2 ghz and it's been so nice. P cores are freed up to do what they're supposed to do. E cores do the chores! Was hot at first before undervolting, but now that's done and temps are high 70s with a 360 mm Corsair AIO. Paired up with a Z690 from MSI and a RTX 3090 it's just the perfect combo. 12900K is completely free to do the data processing for the game, and 3090 handles the graphics side in all my triple A titles without needing to borrow from the system memory at all - needing to pull data through the processor. Resizable bar enabled and it's been awesome. Was worth every penny."

Great Upgrade from 9900K",02-01-2023,"So far this thing is great! I upgraded from the 9900K and this has been a noticeable difference. I'm still in the process of updating drivers and reinstalling some software. I haven't done any overclocking so the Cinebench score and temps are straight stock settings.After seeing all the info on how hot this thing can get I added the Thermalright contact frame. It was a breeze to install. I watched the Gamer's Nexus video about this frame and followed their directions.For the motherboard I went with a MSI Z690 MPG Edge Wifi DDR4 so I could reuse my current RAM. I had to order a LGA 1700 bracket for the NZXT Kraken X73 AIO. I ordered both the frame and the LGA 1700 mount from Amazon and both arrived fast and were exactly what I needed.So far my temps are staying in the general range of my 9900K. I'm planning to do a little gaming this week with it so I'll have a chance to see how it does under my daily use. I also do a bit of Premiere and After Effects so I'm looking forward to seeing how it works there as well.Overall, this is probably way more processor than I NEED. I was still able to do what I needed to do with the 9900K. I built the 9900K in 2020 during the height of the astronomically high PC price wave. I ended up getting this processor for about $100 less than I paid for the 9900K two years ago. So the price-to-performance upgrade for me was a no brainer.If you want a fast processor at a reasonably decent price, this is a great one to get. Just be aware you will need to pay attention to your cooling."

Paired with said gpu and a MSI Tomahawk Z690 with a Noctua NH-D15 Chromax Black cooler, this cpu runs complete marathons around my old 8086k. Certain games that would fully saturate my 8086k while also getting notifications from something like Discord would introduce very bad stutter, however those are completely eliminated with the 12900k. Temps are high when Im doing full resolution photo renders from my DJI Air 2S or Sony a6400 or straight up benchmarking, but that is expected and I'm not one to sweat about 80-90c temps, but if you are I would recommend the 12700k/5900x as they both run cooler and draw less wattage. However in gaming with multiple different Firefox tabs and discord/telegram open, it never even touches 70c, so your experience may vary depending on what type of work load you are doing. Make sure that if you do have a high powered gpu that you also have a high output power supply with a high efficiency rating as well, as my system can suck north of 600-750w full tilt (my power supply being a 1200w platinum EVGA that doesnt break a sweat under full load)."

Insanely fast computation!",10-01-2022,I only used laptops up to this point and this is my first PC build however I got this processor specifically for Workstation class computation and high performance gaming. The Core i9-12900K is blazing fast and uses very little watts for gaming mostly hovering around 65W~80W in the games I have played so far. It renders 3D projects at such a speed I hardly have time to do something else before it is complete which is a great change of pace. I would say the Core i5-12600K is better geared for gaming and this is much more geared towards production or enthusiast class gaming. I highly recommend this processor or anything in the 12th gen Alder Lake family.Full System Specs:ã»ASUS Prime Z690-Aã»Noctua NH-D15 Chromax Blackã»Intel Core i9-12900K 5.2GHzã»NVIDIA RTX A5000 24GB ECCã»G.Skill Trident Z5 RGB 32GB 5600MHzã»Samsung 980 PRO 2TB M.2 NVMeã»Samsung 970 EVO Plus 2TB M.2 NVMeã»Samsung 970 EVO Plus 2TB M.2 NVMeã»Samsung 970 EVO Plus 2TB M.2 NVMeã»EVGA Super Nova G5 850W 80 Plus Goldã»Fractal Torrent Gray E-ATX Mid Tower Case

It's a work horse",14-08-2023,"Using this to serve movies and shows using PLEX, handles continuous recording of several 4K surveillance cameras using Blue Iris, runs a web server (just for family), and controls a Z-wave home automation program involving several nodes.

So many cores to use!",23-08-2022,"I bought this instead of the 12th gen i7 anticipating future demand for more cores. There is a price difference to consider. As many know, more cores doesn't necessarily mean better. Games only use a max of 6 cores, though it may vary from game to game. If you just want to game, buy the i7 series. My 4790k had served me so well, it's still my backup on my old mobo. It's been at least 5 years since I bought ol' reliable. She's been through rough seas. It was time for her to rest easy.For the i9, in terms of gaming performance, only CPU heavy games like RTS games will see any benefit. Multi-tasking also sees benefit, though that's limited to the hard drive it's working off of. Still, I expect great things in the far future.The packaging is a keeper to be sure, too."

Not worth it over the 12700k IMHO",21-07-2022,"The 12900k can be hard to justify. The 12700k is around two-thirds the cost and the difference in performance is only a few percent. Furthermore, you can get away with a moderate cooling solution on the 12700k whereas the 12900k really requires a top of the line cooler which will set you back even more. Even while using the NH-D15 CPU cooler I decided to underclock the 12900k a little bit in order to keep thermals in check, bringing the performance nearer to the 12700k. Given the option to do it over, I would have just gone with a 12700k and saved myself about $250."

Unit was previously opened....",16-12-2021,"I've put together a few systems and run some retail 12900k chips so far and the 12900k is by far an amazingly fast CPU.Unfortunately this one I ordered from Amazon came already opened. As soon as I opened the shipping box I could tell it had been opened before. The edge was uneven and the label crease was loose. I put my X-acto Knife down (which is what you need or something similar to open these as the label is there for a reason) and with just the gentlest of pressure the label peeled away from the center where someone oh so nicely had finely cut the label horizontal to make it easy to fold one side back over the other and with just a quick once over it looked almost normal.If I hadn't opened a few of them already with Intel's fancy new packaging I probably would not have noticed but the way the packaging normally is, it is VERY precise, tight, even lines and you will not be easily or gently opening it up with a simple light finger pry.My biggest fear was there wasn't going to be a CPU in there at all but luckily the right CPU was in there that matched the container batch but if something is sold as new I don't do open boxes.Make sure to check your packages before opening. The seal should be nice and tight and straight. The edges of the back flap should be firm and secure against the other flap and the bottom line/edges should be even and exacting.Give a gentle pull on each corner of the box where the label keeps it sealed to make sure it hasn't been altered or tampered with. It should be VERY firm and unable to just pull open easily. Look at the condition of the box itself around that area and even the gold disk inside.Fresh, brand new i9 12900k's are very pristine and boxed with precision.Still, they are fantastic processors overall and a worthy upgrade from 10th and 11th gen."

The connector pins under the chip",22-08-2022,"Now has a thin film over it. Donât know how it receives electricity and signal from the socket on the motherboard, probably similar to wireless charging, but at least it protects the pins so less likely to damage them while handling the CPU during the build. After all CPU is the most or second mot expensive component in a PC build.Other than that, the increase in core count and speed, couple with gen 4 SSD and RTX 3090 ti, everything else is just slow"

Just took longer and longer to render things.  I guess I wore it out!I just think you'll want a good AIO, and/or a solid water cooling solution for this to really get the best out of it.  I'm not sure a air cooled option will do you any good, but hey I've been wrong many times, so there might be something that can handle the job.All in all, not bad, but it's not going to give you much performance boost over last gen, matter of fact I found out later 13700k beats it in a lot of tests, blargh!

I use my PC mostly for gaming and encoding, so as long as you have a great case with plenty of air flow and a top notch cooler, you can easily run it air cooled without issues as it will just throttle itself when it hits whatever thermal maximum you set in the UEFI BIOS.In gaming workloads it never throttles though and stays at 5.7ghz all core boost the entire time with temps in CPU intensive games anywhere from the upper 50s to mid 60s and upper 40s to mid 50s in non CPU intensive games**Update**I have the CPU now at 5.8ghz with HT disabled and a -75mV offset and it's working like a charm and very stable in gaming workloads and encoding (it downclocks when it hits 90c for encoding workloads but for gaming it stays at 5.8ghz), which is amazing since it's on an air cooled setup, though the setup is as optimal as it gets for air cooling!  As for temps, they are a little lower than running it at 5.7ghz with HT enabled and a -50mV offset.  If I use a -75mV offset with 5.8ghz and HT enabled, my PC crashes.  So disabling HT definitely enables the CPU to use less power.If you're predominantly using your machine for gaming, then I definitely recommend turning HT off regardless as most games tend to run better with HT disabled.  But if you're using it for productivity or a blend of both productivity and gaming, then definitely turn HT on.The only mildly disappointing thing for me is that the memory controller isn't as good as I thought it would be.  Mine runs 48GB DDR5 7400 CL34 at 1.35V on the IMC, but to hit DDR5 7600 CL36 with stability I need to increase the IMC voltage to 1.41V which just isn't worth it if you ask me for such a minor bump in performance.  My previous 13900KF could do 48GB DDR5 7800 at 1.36V on the IMC.Core wise though, the CPU is definitely superior to 13th gen."

Much faster than my previous i7-6850k",19-03-2024,"So I finally upgraded my home workstation, and went to this new i9-14900K. It is incredibly fast. I had a Davinci Resolve video project file that I rendered on my old setup, the i7-6850K and it took just over 22 minutes to complete the render. On the new i9, the exact same file was re exported, took just over 8 minutes..! almost a 3x speed increase.! Also, when you speed up footage in Resolve, the old cpu could not play it back smoothly, it would jump and chug like crazy, the new i9, it plays it back sped up 800% no problems and I can actually see how it looks without having to export the entire video clip to see it playback the retimed footage smoothly. Applications open u p much faster too, but that could be more due to the pcie4.0 nvme system drive that is much faster than the previous version nvme I had in the old build. The one thing I do not like about the new cpu, is the number of pci lanes. You only get 20, 16 are pcie5.0 and 4 are pcie4.0. This wont be an issue for most people, but my old cpu had 40 lanes, allowing me to run 3 GPU's at the same time, and YES, I needed them, I use GPU rendering software that can use up to 8 GPU's in one system on one license and every additional GPU speeds up your render times a lot when rendering out 3D sims. With this new cpu, I can only run 2 GPU's and they run at 8x, cause they share the 16x, and that does leave me 4 full pcie4.0 lanes for the system drive. It is not a deal breaker, and the increased speed overall is well worth it. One thing EVERYBODY should be aware of, is these new intel chips have P cores and E cores. Something my old cpu did NOT have. E-cores can severely impact certain software performance. When I booted up the new machine and tried my Ableton DAW  for the first time, I was expecting to be so happy with a performance boost, and the software was literally almost unusable.! The E-cores were slowing the software down so bad, I could barely change settings in the preferences.! It was that bad. I had to install process lasso ( fantastic software that is free if you have never heard of it ) and disable the use of E-cores for Ableton and then it worked very fast and is great.!"

Powerful but Warm",08-05-2024,"Before you purchase this CPU please also purchase alongside of it purchase a 360 AiO as well, this CPU is in need of it. I'm not trying to say that to scare you but it runs warm. In my (asus) bios I turned on ""Disabled-Enforce all limits"" so that the motherboard doesn't try to do on the fly OC to keep temps low and stability up. I haven't had any crashes or stability issues at all. I did a full platform upgrade from the 10900k to this, I kept my RTX 3080 and the performance bump was actually fully noticeable. I'd say my average temperature for doing basic computing is around 37c with my Lian Li Galahad II Trinity 360. It's a monster of a CPU genuinely and if you are in the market for an upgrade don't hesitate you won't regret it."

i7-14700K is a significant improvement from i9-12900K",31-05-2024,"I decided the difference between the i7 and the i9 didn't justify the price difference, considering I was already getting about 1/3 more performance than my 12th generation i9. I wanted plenty of motherboard resources so I also bought the MSI MEG Z790 ACE, 32 GB of Kingston Fury 6400MT/s DDR5 and a 2TB Samsung 990 NVMe drive.Cooling had been a slight issue with the 12th generation i9, even with a 360mm AIO cooler, so I went custom loop. Along the way I found a GPU water cooler on sale and decided to install a lot of cooling. The Thermaltake 900 tower can take two 560mm radiators, but I wanted some disks, so I went for a 560x140 and a 280x140, both 45mm thick and backed by 6 fans. Four more fans feed air into the case and there's till plenty of clear space for more air to be dragged in.So what's the result? The processor runs at 85C worst case, and only two cores at that temperature. The fast DDR5 does make a significant difference. I initially ran it at 6GT/s then turned it up to 6.2 and finally 6.4. The last change is a 3.5% change in DDR5 speed and that gave me a 2.4% increase in system speed. I kept my old RTX3070 which used to run over 80C and now runs at 62C worst case. So despite more performance the system runs a lot cooler.I mostly run X-Plane 12, which runs the GPU and CPU very hard, continuously. After several hours the cooling water reached 36C and the worst core temperature was 85C. The processor just works. No stability issues with the standard settings on the MSI Z690 motherboard. There are three standard memory tuning options for 6.0, 6.2, and 6.4 GT/s and all work. This will do for me for a few years."

Insane performance at a cost",02-06-2024,"This processor is a speed demon. Gaming, editing, encoding, and whatever else you can think of, it can handle. The performance is there. The value for money is quite good too. Unless you really want top of the line, this chip effectively eliminates the i9 from consideration. 20 cores. 8P and 12E. Boost up to 5.6GHz on 2 threads. I swapped a 12600K for this part and I'm still kinda staggered at just how fast it is in heavily threaded apps. This is a perfect upgrade chip for somebody on an older 12th gen i5 or lower. I wouldn't consider building new with it however.There's a cost to this CPU though. Heat. And power draw. I have an Arctic Liquid Freezer III 360 AIO on this chip, and even with a sizable undervolt, it still throttles at around 230W running 100C. It feels like this chip is almost uncoolable. Unless you go full custom liquid cooling or something. I considered a large air cooler for this chip and I'm glad I went with an AIO. Buyer beware. This thing runs hot. It's also incredibly fast. If you can cool it this thing will fly."

Fast, but unstable when overclocked.",11-01-2024,"I built 3 systems using 14900 series. They all had serious stability problems when in use.  After researching for weeks and reinstalling OS with no better result.  I finally disabled overclocking ""AI overclocking"", which was running as high as 1.6v.  I also found a BIOS setting after running some tools and set it INTEL FAIL SAFE.  this allowed me to run the AVX2 stress test successfully.  It basically throttles the chip.I can't tell you the frustration this caused figuring this out.  Everything from chrome browsers to Adobe CS would crash randomly for no apparent reason every few minutes while all ""tests"" showed it was fine.  I lowered my refresh rate to 60 from 120, killed AI overclocking and set the INTEL setting and now have a very stable system. It outperforms my 5950x when encoding, which is impressive.  It does run HOT even with water cooling.  IF I had it to do over again, I would avoid 13000 and 14000 chips as there is a OODLE issue as well when it comes to gaming with Unreal 5.  Basically an unfixable hardware flaw that affects some chips.Here's the thing, you will not notice a difference as nothing I use with the exception of HANDBRAKE, ever comes close to maxing out the chip when in use.  Adobe CS uses my 3080ti and the intel quicksync iGPU simultaneously which rarely went above 40%, and usually was around 15-20 when editing.  HW encodes for HD were at 350fps, software, 250, intel 300.  So a small advantage in Adobe CS is why I went with the 14900K vs KF.System was using ""AI overclocking"" pushing it to 6.2 roughly single core.  Disabled in BIOS now.Specs: Asus z290a Wifi II, Corsair 96GB DDR5 5600, Samsung 990 Pro, CPU Water cooled, 3080tiSo the ""K"" is basically useless for me at this point and don't see myself doing it manually as it's just not worth it to me.  That said, when stable, it's a very capable chip."

6.2GHZ 8200mts cl38 Daily Driver.",04-04-2024,"This professional CPU isn't designed for the average user. However, if you're a tinkerer at heart, eager to dive deeper than the surface-level information often presented in YouTube ""videos"" (or should we say, commercials), this is unquestionably for you. I've acquired multiple units for various builds/configurations from a wide array of retailersâBest Buy, Newegg, and others included.For those considering making a purchase, I highly recommend using an Apex/Apex Encore MOBO or another reputable 2 DIMM board, particularly for AM5 or LGA1700, if overclocking is your goal. A high-quality cooler is crucial; for those opting for an AIO, ensure it includes at least an 8th gen Asetek pump and a 360 Thickboy copper radiator with performance fansâAvoid the aesthetically pleasing but functionally inferior Lian Li reversed SL Infinity Fans. Genuine static pressure fans, capable of efficiently doing the job, are what you need. Despite what your favorite YouTuber might suggest, you should prioritize efficiency over aesthetics.When selecting DDR5, opt for GOOD BINNED options. If a high-binned QVL compatible set isn't your choice, at a minimum, go for HYNIX A for single rank and HYNIX M for dual rank.The 14900K, when expertly tuned, becomes a gaming and multitasking powerhouseâachieving 43 to 44k in R23, with 6.2GHz boosting, 5.9GHz across its 8 physical cores and 8 threads, and 16 physical e-cores at 4.7GHz for a total of 32 threads, of which only 8 are virtual. With hyper-threading and e-cores enabled, it supports 8200 to 8400 MTS CL38 DDR5 RAM, boasts sub-55ns bus latency, and sub-9.3ns FWL. It's a marvel in Aida64 full, minus SSD, burn-in stress test stability. Adjusting all cores down to 5.8 and boosting to 6.0 can further reduce bus latency to easily below 50ns...Did I mention overall CPU temperatures typically remain between 35 to 40Â°C under heavy gaming loads, rarely exceeding 50Â°C? Despite the capability of 3 EATX connections to easily deliver over 400W of power, I'd advise against exceeding 325W daily, as the performance gains beyond this point are minimal without extreme overclocking and cooling methodsâincreased voltage requirements could significantly shorten the lifespan of your CPU. For tinkerers, this CPU is a dream come true.As of this dateâ4-4-2024: We anticipate future silicon manufacturing constraints will evolve, but that's a discussion for another time.The X3D Elephant in the room: Don't worry, I own one, and this is about science, not purchase bias...We'll sidestep intricate discussions about CLDO, FCLK, and MCLK concerns, and why the substantial L3 cache has become an essential workaround for the instability caused by chiplet-based IMC in handling DDR5 for gamers. If the augmentation of the L3 cache wasn't primarily to address DDR5 issues stemming from the chiplet design, why not significantly enhance and accelerate the L1 cache? The design doesn't allow for it since it's not monolithic, which wouldn't be practical. Those well-versed in the subject matter understand this. While chiplets represent the future, we must acknowledge that this future hasn't fully materialized for every aspect of computing, allowing us to look beyond the ""normie YouTuber AMD cults.""Indeed, I own a 7800X3D build and absolutely adore it! It excels in gaming... primarily in GAMING! Thus, there's no cause for concern. Let's briefly touch on the ""benefits"" like reduced thermals and supposed platform longevity (as if motherboard chipset upgrades and advancements in power delivery methods don't occur... humor me, over the planned 6 years). I, too, long for Z390 features on my Z790 board (/end sarcasm), not to mention the potential for longer boot times when tinkering with DDR5 or PBO, or even under normal conditions, and texture stutter/tearing... oops, and all those other delightful topics Lisa tends to highlight without addressing the influence of influencers with communications degrees rather than computer science degrees.  Just having fun, do what you love!I don't blame Amazon, Intel, AMD, or Nvidia more than the other. Manufacturing and shipping issues happen. The chip I received from Amazon didn't meet my expectations, but my other purchases have been exceptional. By chance alone, the other four 14900Ks I've received from various distributors have been stellar!Note:Settings in pictures are daily driven....No stability concerns all AIDIA 64 Stress tested for multiple hours and hundreds of gaming/workload hours.  I can get bus latency down to under 50NS but need to decrease core clock to locked 5.8GHZ to stay at safe voltage....

IF YOU WANT THE AIR COOLED OPTION",11-02-2024,"I'm not going to go over the same performance reviews others have done, yes its very fast for only $550 its the king of the poor mans build PC. my last PC its replacing was a $1000 10980xe and looking at the numbers the 14900k in average is 70-77% faster than the 10980xe. the only disadvantage between the 2 was the 10980xe had 48 PCIe lanes and ran 32c to 56c hot.i can't say the same about the 14900k heat, its spreader is almost half of the 10980xe. you can't just simply add a stock cooler or a ""MC'watercooler"" and expect the problem will solve itself. this is the first CPU in my 26 yrs of building PC's you have to plan out your cooler set up.ever since a 2012 water leak from these Mc'watercoolers (all in one 2 fan radiator kits sold by name brands) Ive never trusted them cost me $1500 in damages. The only water coolers that don't leak for me were the ones i built but water cooling is expensive and you have to inspect them at least every 3 months for debris in the tank or leaks. with air i only have to clean the pc 2x a year.yes you can control temps with an air cooler, and get the same temps as a 3 fan radiator water cooler. I'll post the results without adding a watt limit in the mobo post screen.here is the parts i bought to air cool running the new cinabench 2024 for 30 mins i can get max performance on a defualt non OC not hitting above 99C on the P cores1. Noctua NH-D15 chromax.Black | Dual-Tower CPU Cooler | 140mm | Black2. Noctua NF-A15 HS-PWM chromax.Black.swap (this adds a 3rd fan for the air cooler you'll need it)3.

Easycargo 40mm Heatsink Kit 40mmx40mmx20mm (this you place on the flat base of the noctua cooler will help dissipate heat)5. Easycargo 100pcs Heatsink Assortment Kit Small Cooler Aluminum Heat (these you throw on the back of your mobo on and around the mount brackets you'll me amazed how adding heat sinks on the back of the mobo will reduce temps)6. Thermal Grizzly Kryonaut (this is the best thermal grease cooler by 1-2c cooler than artic silver mx 6)7. Thermalright Intel 12th/13th Generation LGA1700 Anti-Bending Buckle ( a must add a little thermal grease on the cpu side flaps this buckle is 100% aluminum will al help dissipate heat.then i went to my mother board software options (mobo is an MSI MEG Z790 ACE MAX) select ""CPU cooler tuning"" select ""tower air cooling"" which will limit the wattage draw to under 300w also note if you are not using a Water Cooling Reservoir  you should also use this option, water cooling a 14900k and OC really does require a reservoir, and a 4x 120 fan size radiator if you're simply using a pre-built 2x fan radiator its not enough to handle the 14900k and the CPU is known for drawing 370w plus!!so using air cooled i got a 2371 score with no watt limiter option an temps were 78-100c on the p cores, and with the 300 watt limit the score was  2328 with temps 70-99c never hit 100c case the limiter would kick in. (note this is from CPU testing that punishes the CPU realistically i don't see this CPU going over 88c even on the most demanding game in 3 years.i personally do not recommend OC this CPU its already been pushed to its limits by INTEL at best for another 100 watts when all you're getting is 3-4 more FPS and that's not worth it. and all these people bragging a 6.2-6.5ghz OC, there just flexing for clout, then they take the CPU back to default. i already have my P cores spiking to 6.002 at 288-300 watts, and under 99c temps; adding 0.198mhz will meaning nothing for apps and gaming.personal note the MSI MEG Z790 ACE MAX Gaming Motherboard is absolutely amazing at squeezing out all the performance of the 14900k worth the $700 price never crashed during testing that 26 power phases is godly  compared to my last gen EVGA x299 dark had 12 phase...RIP EGA :("

Main improvement is lower power cost day-day",03-05-2024,"I upgraded from an 8700k to this 14700k nearly 8 years later. Performance-wise, the difference is fairly negligible to me, and that is reflected in the 'real' specs. Going from 6 cores to 20 cores isnt really a 3x+ increase when most of those cores are 'efficiency cores'. User benchmark puts 14700k as only being 47% faster than the 8700k, despite being 8 years and 6 generations apart.The main improvement from my point of view is the reduced idle/casual power use. My UPS tells me that for my 8700k/1070ti system I drew ~0.43 Kw, and my new 14700k/4070ti super draws ~0.31 Kw watching YT, browsing the web (includes fans, monitors, etc).Mostly just wanted more balance for the new graphics card, since that's what does most of the heavy lifting these days anyway.

It has no problem with any kind of processing you can throw at it.Runs hot and causes the cooler to spool up when playing poorly programmed games, but the water cooler is up to the task. Still, it reveals what games are just piles of trash code.Just remember to update your BIOS because it's still a relatively new processor. And stay away from Windows 11."

While doing benchmarks, a few Pcores would hit 100c while others would hit 92c. Ecores was about 87c and low of 83c on 4.3Ghz all Pcore and 4.2Ghz all Ecore. Offset voltage was at 0.3. After switching back to auto clock, I still managed the same temps, but getting 5.1-5.2Ghz on Pcore and 4.3 on Ecore. If my case allowed 120mm fans, I would of most definitely installed 240mm AIO cooler. That for sure would of helped with the temps and get me higher benchmark numbers.When it came to rendering a 20 minute 4k video on sony Vegas Pro 18 (IGPU only), it took about 15 minutes to complete it vs my I9 9900k that would of taken over an hour to finish it (RTX 3060). This system was meant specifically VR/light video editing. So, considering how fast it is on the rendering without a dedicated GPU, I am pretty excited about it. I haven't tried the VR aspect yet.Overall, if you are coming from a few gen older CPU and want to upgrade to the 14900k, you wont be disappointed."

Simply awesome",01-05-2024,"Switching from a 5800x3d for my 4080 super.. this is one heck of a cpu. I only put a $60 280mm aio ""I'd cooling"" and put it on smart fan. After that gaming has been a breeze with crazy high fps that give me 99% GPU usage in every game. Jedi survivor is getting over 130fps with dlss quality on. Which is unheard of from everything I read. Totally glad I went with this over 7800x3d. Mobo was much cheaper with every bell and whistle I wanted. My newest build is definitely nice enough to leave any builder drooling.. Thanks to this cpu at its core."

Powerful!",23-04-2024,"I bought this as an upgrade from my trusty i9 10900k. I was worried the performance boost would be marginal but I was pleasantly surprised to get a solid boost on 1440p with my rtx 4080 super. Playing Helldivers 2, my fps went from mid 70s-90s to 120-140s at everything maxed out. Playing VR sims like il-2 and DCS has mostly eliminated little stutters and performance drops. Similarly, MSFS 2020 at ultra settings in populated areas provides a smooth and stable experience. My temps generally stay around 65 to 75 underload/demanding gaming. I have seen brief spikes to 80. I'm using an EVGA CLC 280mm cooler. I may need to reapply thermal paste."

Possibly better memory support than i9-13900K",05-04-2024,"Once they came down in price, I did get a i9-14900K as an ""upgrade"" from a i9-13900KF to  i9-14900K .  It's OK but I can't rave over it.  It is more of an sideways change rather than an upgrade.The i9-14900K is fast but not more so that a i9-13900K.  For me, the Cinebench R23 scores are about the same for 13th versus 14th gen.  Though the i9-14900K appears to run DDR5 more stably and at higher frequencies than the i9-13900K.  Also, the i9-14900K is enabled for XTU AI enable tuning in XTU but it's not that helpful.  I even wonder if it is worth getting a K at all, these CPU's are plenty fast for gaming without overclocking.I did NOT notice a significant improvement in the operating temperatures.  Maybe a slight improvement but I did flush out the cooling system and clean out the water block so I am doubtful that the running temps are better.  Also, I suggest that you NOT let these chips get anywhere near TjMax (100C).  I had one i9-13900KF literally fail due to allowing it to get to TjMax frequently when stress testing.  A second one became slightly flaky.I thought the built in ARC display support of the K version might be helpful since I intended to devote the graphics card to the gaming monitor and use the built-in ARC on a side display.  But as it turns out, it wasn't worth it for me.  If you are gaming with this level of processor, you really need a comparable graphics card but most of them will drive four displays.  IMO, you are better off getting a KF and spending the money so saved on better graphics card.The original asking price was insane, I bought it on a whim on a late night.  On the morning morning after, I had buyers remorse, tried to cancel but could not, so instead, I refused the package.  It took literally 6 months to get a refund.  That was rather irksome."

It's the perfect fit for this monster PC I just built.",07-12-2023,"A lot of people are upset with the 14900k because of the minimal performance leap thar came between it and the 13900k. I say who cares. If you have a 13900k, don't upgrade, but if you have an older PC or 12th Gen, this is a worthy upgrade. I absolutely love mine. It's a monster of a CPU.I honestly don't recommend air cooling it. It can get pretty hot and there are only a small handful of air coolers that can handle this 14900k without setting power limits (which most people don't know how to do, let alone even know what that means)If you're not doing a custom water loop to cool your 14900k, I recommend you do what I've done to cool mine, you dont neeeed to, but it helps. I have an AIO (All-In-One Cooler) and I setup a push-pull configuration on my radiator. That means I have 3 fans on the bottom blowing in through the radiator, and 3 more fans blowing up and out of the case. Both are blowing upward. It creates more airflow. One side is pushing the air, the other side is helping pull that air through. Then I got a thermalright contact frame. Any LGA 1700 contact frame should work but the thermalright version is cheap. It might say 12th/13th Gen but it will also work on 14th Gen. So get an AIO, setup a push-pull fan configuration and get a contact frame. It's helping my Temps significantly. I typically stay in the high 50's or low 60's during 4K gaming. This CPU draws a ton of power so you might see it bump up to 80â° occasionally, for a very brief moment. (Maybe 1 second or less)"

Please note that the F in the 14700KF means NO iGPU",24-02-2024,"Wanted to purchase the unlocked version of the 20 core 14th gen processor and saw that this was a cheaper option at the time. All the description says is that ""Discrete graphics is required."" It would be much more helpful by adding a line that says the F version stands for no integrated graphics card. If you're doing any kind of workstation work such as video editing, most software will take advantage of the processor having an iGPU as well and so I'm actually losing performance with this model version. I'll have to return the item to purchase the correct version without an F. I would give it a full 5 stars if it had the line explaining the F version."

My station is primarily used as a work station though it scores well with PC Mark 10 and cinebench. 3D Mark declares the obvious that I need to upgrade my video card from several years ago. The ai over clocking helps in the bench marking significantly. Lot easier to overclock than in the early 2000's on my core 2quad.

So far so good.",22-10-2023,"Sorta came from a 13900k but I gave that to a relative after their x299/i9-7940x system began to have issues. He bought a z790 board and was amazed how far ahead the 13900k is in comparison an overclocked Skylake-X processor. He fixed the issue with the x299 system, but he decided to stay with Raptor Lake. All of which is okay by me because that old 13900k had no overclocking headroom, and I could only undervolt it by 5mv before it became unstable. I was going to buy another 13900k or maybe the ks version, but I decided to wait for the 14900k.The 14900k I got on the other hand has some overclocking headroom. I already set all P-cores to 5.8GHz, while keeping the double-core Turbo Boost at 6.0GHz. I also set the cache to 5.2Ghz and it's completely stable. I was not able to raise the multiplier at all with my 13900k. Just happy my 14900k isn't a lottery loser.While the clock of both the 13900ks and 14900k are the same, the 13900ks has a cherry picked memory controller. If you're looking to do a ton of RAM overclocking then the 13900ks may be the way to go.... but that's not to say if you'd get a 14900k with a good memory controller. Both my 13900k and 14900k work with DDR5-7200 RAM with XMP set, and no adjustments to the memory controller voltages.If you're buying the 14900k off the get-go and building a new system around it, then I recommend pairing it with a motherboard that has the BIOS Flashback feature."

A Monster CPU with One Major Caveat",20-10-2023,"I built PC with the new Intel i9-14900k, and I must say, it's a beast of a processor. Coming from an i7-8700k, the performance boost is nothing short of incredible. Multitasking, gaming, and content creation have all seen a significant improvement. Multithreaded applications and gaming experiences run smoother.  It's a productivity powerhouse. The clock speeds are no slouch either, making it excellent for single-threaded tasks and gaming. The major downside of this CPU is the heat it generates. Even with a high-end cooling solution, it tends to run hot, and that's something you must take into consideration when setting up your cooling solution. Be ready for this CPU to draw a significant amount of power at full load. It can put quite a load on your power supply and might necessitate an upgrade if you're not already prepared. The Intel i9-14900k is an incredible processor, and the upgrade from an i7-8700k is substantial. Its exceptional performance in various tasks justifies its price tag.

Tried intel xtu auto overclocking, ai suite, and asus ai overclocking via bios.. none of that worked. Had to just dig into bios, set limits, and manually tune each core. Now system is stable and solid. Been benchmarking and stress testing for a few days now. Temps are great, and I am happy. Not sure if mb is culprit, gonna get another board and test the chip. Just be ready for some trouble. Looked over many forums of others having the same issues."

Very happy with 14900K, the reviews are misleading. It's feels way better then they say it performs.",04-11-2023,"This CPU is amazing. Feels like magic. I have it running in an Asrock PG Sonic 700 series, with 32GB GSkill DDR5 7200, and a Crucial T700 2TB PCIe 5.0 SSD and Cooler Master Masterliquid Atmos 360. Anytime u do anything, even click a icon the cpu jump up to 6Ghz. And for me stay under 30C Idle and under 70C Max Load. Never mind what temperatures it runs at, I can't get it to throttle. Seems like all of its power is available on demand all the time. And I'm basically computing in Real Time. The 13900K was fast, significantly faster then the 12900K, and this CPU even though on paper it doesnt look like they did much, and in benchmarks it looks close, it still feels like 15-20% faster the 13900K when your using it. I feel like it runs cooler then the 13900K, the 13900K was the hot chip. I don't know how they do it. Like I said it's like magic how it stays at 6GHz and stays so cool."

Worth it if <13th gen",17-11-2023,Was going to wait until 15th gen to upgrade my 10900k but decided to go for it. While the 10900k is still a powerhouse this is a good upgrade and I am happy with. This processor is ridiculously fast and handles everything we would expect it to. Cyberpunk picked up 10fps with a 3080 but runs super smooth now at 4k with RT. I did pair this with a z790 Aorus and 32gb ddr5 6400.******** AT Own Risk*******  Suggest undervolting in bios if you know what you are doing. I am running this cpu 5.7 all cores - 1.24v on a custom loop. I see idle temps 31c - gaming 60c and cinebench 89c.  It will run hot if you're on air and do not adjust the default voltage. There are plenty of youtube videos out there as a resource.  Overall great processor

The best CPU I've owned so far. Rivaling even the 5900X! Intel is killing the game as of now.",25-02-2022,"I upgraded to this CPU after some HEAVY research, asking Reddit (Both Intel and AMD subreddits), weighing in money VS performance gained. I have used AMD since I was a teen and started building computers. The conclusion is this: It is an amazing CPU, runs faster and cooler than my Ryzen 7 1700. The price AND performance VS AMD (Also including a board) was better than if I had went with a Ryzen 7 5800X.Some background information: I wanted to upgrade after receiving an Amazon gift card (I have never ordered computer parts from Amazon though). I upgraded from a Ryzen 7 1700, with an ASUS x370-f board. I really wanted to upgrade, and was sad also that Windows 11 did not support my CPU! I will give it to Microsoft for this, as it made A LOT of people upgrade their entire computers, all for basically the same OS as of now with newer looks, and not much done under the hood (EXCEPT for 12th gen Intel, so good news there too). Sadly, my old board STILL doesn't support the Ryzen 7 5000 series, and only the 3000 series (They are working on a BIOS apparently for the 5000 series, because of people who were in my shoes). I first almost ordered the Ryzen 7 3800XT, for $400! After a couple hours of research, asking, and thinking about it... I cancelled that order (Thankfully) and thought ""Well, if I am going to spend this much on upgrading my CPU, I might as well go all in/spend a little more for something better, as this may be my last big upgrade in this regard for awhile."" I was then going to get the Ryzen 7 5800X with an Asus board. There lied a problem of price, I could not find a board AND get that CPU still within my budget (At-least not a board that wasn't worse than the one I had in ways). I mentioned I had posted on the AMD subreddit, and even they suggested I go Intel (Intel is just killing it as of now, hands down, although I am sure AMD will retaliate). I ended up getting the MSI Z690-A DDR4 (I wish I had the money for DDR5 RAM, I would have went with the DDR5 version as it was basically the same price). I had A LOT of second thoughts on this board though, as it just didn't seem ""Premium"" as the one I had (I am going to do a whole review on it after this. I'll save my Pros & Cons for there.) This CPU also auto-clocks itself up or down depending on the load (Saw it clock down to 1GHz, although not for long, for example if not much processing power is warranted, which makes sense and I wish everything did). So if idling, it will clock down and save power/heat/and therefore longevity is increased. I absolutely love this CPU coming from AMD. Anyways...If you have a Corsair H100I RGB Platinum or similar cooler already: The included 1200 screws work just fine with the 1700 socket and this CPU, even though you are supposed to get the 1700 kit/screws for this CPU (Which I did, but they are taking FOREVER to ship, so I googled, and someone said using the 1200 screws will work just fine). I get better temps. than my Ryzen 7 1700. I can even overclock EVEN MORE but have no need, and no point.TL:DRUpgraded from: Ryzen 7 1700, Asus Rog Strix x370-f gaming.Upgraded to: i7-12700K, MSI Z690-A DDR4.Parts kept: 4x8GB 32GB DDR4 CL16 3000MHz RAM (With XMP, D.O.C.P), RTX 2070. The RAM works great with this CPU as well, although it TECHNICALLY (Latency wise, runs at 2T on Intel instead of 1T on AMD) runs slower than when on AMD (AMD's infinity fabric) but obviously whatever Intel is doing makes up for that, and therefore my RAM either runs faster/the same)Pros: It is an amazing CPU for price VS performance. The i5-12600K is good as well (I almost just went with it), and you would be fine going with it for gaming (As even it still has more cores technically than the Ryzen 7 5800X, it also beats the 5800X even though THIS CPU is supposed to be its comparison rival brother.) This CPU has cool temps on my Corsair H100I RGB Platinum cooler, and the P&E core structure are REALLY cool and fun to watch when doing tasks/gaming. It shipped fast!Cons: Literally none with the CPU itself. Just with shipping - It shipped really fast! Was here in 2-3 days after purchasing on here. The biggest complaint I have is Amazon's shipping (SO BE AWARE OF THIS) I have never ordered computer parts from Amazon, and have always used New-egg. They just left the CPU in my mail-box, and if it weren't for me looking at my camera's, and looking out for this part, it would have sat in the mail-box all day. My mail-box sadly is not very weather proof as well, and if it had been raining... It wouldn't have been good. Although it did come in a big box around it. The CPU also was jarred loose and flopping around in the box (Not held into the front window).I hope this review helps people!"

stable, fast, and smooth.",24-01-2024,"This is my first intel build coming from past AMD builds (Ryzen, FX, Athlon, Phenom). I am nowhere near a hardware engineer level to distinguish or feel the differences in performances but for the average gamer and turning on this CPU with instructions followed, this chip is very well to be worth it and confident to be future proof until at least 2026. I overclocked this via the motherboard/bios settings and it stays cool with a $30 fan cooler. (don't get a super cheap or small cpu cooler otherwise would risk overheating) Just follow installation instructions carefully the chip is delicate. windows experience rating is a 9.7 so that says it all. If you have the extra 50-60$ go with the i9 i should have done that. AMD seems to be all the hype but I see why Intel won't be going away anytime soon this is a solid chip."

Awesome upgrade and great value",04-12-2023,"Compared to the Coffee Lake generation I had been (willingly) stuck on for 4 years this is a massive leap. Before buying I was a bit skeptical since I'm not a fan of Intel's newer way of handling cores, but the first thing I tried when I got it was emulating PS3 games and right off the bat I saw compile times cut tenfold and stability at least doubled.The older CPUs from the 8th, 9th, and 10th gen are perfectly usable for most people so if you're on a budget maybe look on the used market for those. But if you really need something powerful this is a good option."

Run dual displays smoothly without any hiccups, here are my notesâ¦",05-08-2023,"This item has been with me for a very short time.So I recently decided to upgrade my gaming rig, and after extensive research, I made the bold choice to order the Intel Core i7-12700K Gaming Desktop Processor with Integrated Graphics and 12 Cores. Let me tell you, this processor is the absolute best! With its 12 cores, it brings a whole new level of performance to my gaming experience. Whether I'm playing graphically demanding AAA titles or indulging in intense multitasking, this processor effortlessly handles it all. And what's even better is that it comes with integrated graphics, meaning I didn't have to shell out extra cash for a separate graphics card, yet. The integrated Graphics offer the flexibility of running dual displays smoothly without any hiccups.

Watch the price on this one",02-01-2023,"The i7-12700K is in the top 5 for gaming CPUs right now. AMD is doing fairly well as of late but Intel has a solid performance lead with it's single core performance on newer generation chips.If you're on the fence and want a quick top 5 for overall gaming performance, it goes as follows:1. i9-13900k2. i7-13700k3. i9-12900k4. i5-13600k5. i7-12700kThis chip is no slouch though, it trades blows with the 13600K in some situations if overclocked but overclocking isn't really fair for comparison.In conclusion, if you're looking around this price point, check both this CPU and the 13600k. Pick whichever is cheaper. Higher end 12th gen Intel motherboards can be flashed in the BiOS to take 13th gen CPUs too, but do your research on those before going that route. This one will serve you well. :)"

Works Great!",15-02-2022,"It's been roughly 6-7 years since I last build my gaming computer. Upgrading to this has been more than significant. As of this writing, I hope you've done your research the I7-12700k's price point and its competition. For this price point, it may be the top dog.Some things to consider before purchasing:1) Make sure you are purchasing a LGA 1700 motherboard. I went with the DDR4 motherboard because DDR5 is still at its infancy. The DDR5 ram may not be the best option for your buck right now. You'll be fine with DDR4.2) This CPU does consume a lot more power compared to its predecessor. Double check if your PSU will be enough. There are online resources that will help you calculate your PSU. It's always good to have a little overhead.3) Make sure your heatsink has retrofit screws that's compatible with this motherboard. You can purchase them separately. If you have a heatsink that's very old (<2016), it's more than likely it may not be compatible.Good luck!"

A better deal for most people vs. the i9",04-08-2022,"I had been planning to hold off for Raptor Lake, but my Z370 mobo died, and I decided to go ahead and get an Alder Lake i7.  So far it's impressive.  It runs much cooler than my i9-9900k (mild OC) ( 59C-63C under a gaming load vs 75C+) but that could've been due to the my old AIO being in it's death throws for the past few months.  3DMark CPU score went up noticeably as well.  Overall, I'm pretty happy with it.  Haven't messed around with overclocking yet, but there doesn't seem to be as much headroom left as there used to be,  from what I've read 5.3 Ghz is about what you can expect.  The days of getting another 800Mhz - 1 Ghz+  over stock clocks out of a CPU are gone it seems."

Ridiculously fast",15-01-2022,"I've had this overclocked at 5.0 GHz for a couple weeks now and it hasn't skipped a beat. I bought an MSI Z690 MPG Edge Motherboard to pair with this beast of a chip. Keep in mind, it does NOT come with a cooler so make sure you have a reputable thermal paste and a solid cooler to pair with this. I have a pre-filled watercooler (Corsair Hydro Series H115i Pro) which is giving me temps idle as low as 19Â°C (not joking, look at the picture). Under full load, I have yet to hit over 50Â°C even gaming at 1440p (2k resolution). If I'm being quite honest, this CPU is overkill for gaming. If you have the extra money, go for it. If not, a i5-12600k will be just as powerful for less money."

Blue Innovation",22-05-2022,"This 12th Gen Unlocked CPU is amazing for a Gamer PC Build compared to the Ryzen 5000 Series. The new LGA 1700 boards have an added benefit compared to the aging AM4 boards. This CPU support PCIe 5.0 and DDR4 or DDR5 RAM. I like how efficient Intel designed it because the P cores are optimized for gaming while the efficient E cores deal with the background tasks. Make sure to buy a good AIO cooler because the CPU will run hot when there is lots of load! Please note a new Intel CPU will come with its Intel factory seal outside the box. Moreover, I ran the CPU under 6% when running Minecraft with raytracing."

intel still proves to be a reliable brand",24-12-2022,I've bounced over years from AMD to INTEL and at one point settled back to INTEL.  I typically go for the i7 processors to get more life out of my systems (rather than i3 or i5 processors).  I have gotten many more years than thought out of systems and still show good usability even after 6 years.  The processor installs easily provided you have some knowledge in building computers.  No blue screening to report used with ASUS Z690M-Plus motherboard and G.SKILL memory.

works great",01-09-2022,"the CPU works great and is super fast.  i didn't really want to pay for the latest and greatest, mainly because i have found that a 10% increase can add 50% to the price of the CPU.  one thing to watch out for, there is no cooling fan in this package, so you have to buy one.  you can get the CPU with a fan, but it's a different part number.  personally, even though it cost more to buy the fan separately, i believe the Noctua cooler i got will work much better than anything Intel provides."

However, this CPU is just amazing for every other task and overall I am happy with it.Paired with the Asus B660-I Gaming board and 32gb of DDR5 5200mhz RAM and I'm truly satisfied with my rig performance so far.

Only Three Cents,5.0,"5.0 out of 5 stars
Solid CPU that is stable",27-06-2022,"My three cents:After reading reviews of the I9-12900k, this seems like a better choice to me regardless of price. I am seeing very little difference in single threaded benchmarks, and maybe 15-18% faster multi threaded performance on the I9-12900k. But that comes at the price of using a lot more power and hitting over 90 degrees Celsius in some cases on temperatures when stress testing. While I don't normally overclock my system, I bet you could likely hit those performance numbers with an overclock on the 12700K if you really wanted to."

Great CPU for gaming and multitasking",18-01-2022,Great CPU so far. Only limiting this CPU at the moment is the early versions of Z690 motherboard software that might not be overclocking at optimal levels (using auto overclock). Make sure you have a good CPU cooler or a cooler designed for the LGA 1700. Currently the Gigabyte settings for overclocking (bios or windows app) is pushing the CPU above spec and will cause throttling.

I was considering AMD Ryzen 7 5800X when I read the benchmark for Intel's 12th generation CPUs are better than the 5800X running Adobe software.  But it has a bad reputation for hogging power.  The attached screen shot shows that power consumption slightly exceed the TDP of 125W during Lightroom batch export.  But to my surprise, once the export is finished, power consumption is very low, even less than my AMD 4800H based laptop.  Background processing uses the more efficient E-cores."

4K video editing beast on a budget. 10 Cores for under $200. Premiere Pro workhorse!",04-07-2024,"EDIT: Fixed the previous issues. Was a software issue, not a hardware issue.NEW REVIEW (5 Stars):I'm a video editor, and I usually only upgrade once every 5-7 years, and this thing more than DOUBLES the performance of my old i5 7600K 4C/4T CPU from 2017.  6P/4E cores for under $200. Wow. I was able to pick this thing up for $150 on Black Friday in 2023 and it's worth every penny.Paired it with a Deepcool AK400 cooler which I picked up for around $30 and it keeps temps around 70-75 while running Cinebench and other similar benchmarks (it's worth noting, however, that I haven't overclocked it).This with a $300 RTX 3060 from MSI with 12GB of VRAM and I have a beast of a 4K Premiere Pro workhorse that should keep me happy for another 5-7 years.A quick note if you use Premiere Pro and aren't aware:If you use Premiere Pro, you absolutely NEED the K series of intel chips. Do NOT cheap out and get an intel chip without an iGPU! The integrated graphics chips in the K series have decoders specifically designed for h264 footage to decode that footage in Premiere Pro, allowing for buttery-smooth playback on your timeline with little to no dropped frames.According to benchmarks, without the iGPU, you can see as much as a 20-30% drop in such tasks! Do yourself a favor and spend an extra $20-$30 to get that iGPU for decoding! (You'll still need a good dedicated GPU to handle GPU-intensive effects.Hope this helps."

Great in 2023",17-12-2023,"Purchased for $150 for Cyber Monday 2023 and it's been excellent. In Cyberpunk 2077, with Ray Tracing on and a mix of ultra/high settings, I've reached 60-120 FPS (usually hovering between 70-90) with a Gigabyte Eagle 4060. I've hit 500+ FPS in League of Legends, and with V-Sync on, I've had no noticeable drop from 165 FPS. On sale, this is an excellent processor and an INCREDIBLE upgrade from my previous 9400f which was and still is a very capable processor. Temps are very stable with a Peerless Assassin cooler; I don't believe I've reached or exceeded 60 degrees Celsius. I haven't overclocked yet - if I even will, because current performance is excellent - but I've read that this processor overclocks a fair amount."

There isn't currently a better budget option",15-04-2024,"Bought this for my second computer, and can say it is the budget king at the moment. It does not overclock very well though compared to a 13600k. I tested this CPU with a 3080, and 4080 and can say it gets the job done, but at 1080p I saw bottlenecking with both graphics cards."

Impressive",12-11-2023,"Decided to finally upgrade from my 6 or 7 year old Asus X99 platform and 980ti sli (yes that old) to an Asus Tuf Z790/12600k/Tuf 4080 OC gamers edition. My old 5820k was creating a HUGE bottleneck issue for my GPU, which I installed about a month prior. What a difference I must say. Now that I'm finally out of the stone age, I'm in awe as to how much things have changed in the PC gaming world. This current build smokes everything I throw at it so far. Which admittedly has only been a few games and benchmarks. I paired the processor and GPU with water blocks from an AIO Corsair system for my CPU, and a separate Granzon custom loop for the GPU. All I can say is wow. Fast boot times, 150 plus fps in some games like The Division 2 with medium settings at 1440p. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this processor/Z790 motherboard/GPU combo. Are there better options for better performance or there? Absolutely. But for the money, I believe that the average gamer would be hard pressed to find any significant issues with that platform. I was skeptical at first, as this is the first I5 processor I ever purchased for a PC, but as I stated previously, I am quite satisfied with my decision to take a leap of faith. Again, I highly recommend this processor. Can't beat the performance at this price point with a stick."

Too good",03-10-2023,"The Intel Core i5-12600K processor has exceeded all my expectations and has taken my informal experience to a new level.As a technology enthusiast, I am always anxious to try the last and better hardware pieces, and this chip has not disappointed me at all. The performance of this CPU is simply impressive.With its 10ths and 16 threads, it is able to handle the most demanding tasks easily.Either playing last generation games, editing videos in 4K or performing intensive productivity tasks, the i5-12600k demonstrates a soft and ravenal performance in each situation. The intel thread director technology is a great advance, since it improves theAdministration of threads and energy efficiency, which translates into a better performance in multi-hilo applications and a lower operating temperature.In addition, the support for DDR5 RAM adds an additional impulse to the speed and response capacity of the system. Overclocking is a delight with this processor.With an unlocked multiplier and an efficient technical management, I could easily increase the clock speed and obtain a better performance.This is a dream come true for enthusiasts who seek to squeeze each drop of performance of their system. In summary, the Intel Core i5-12600k is a performance beast that offers an exceptional user experience.If you are looking for an last generation processor for games, content creation or any demanding task, this CPU is an outstanding choice.I am delighted with your performance and I can't wait to see what I can achieve with you in the future.They highly recommended!"

Modern midrange priced Intel processor.",21-12-2023,"This processor with the rebuild of our desktop build has been very loyal and powerful. Mixed with a DeepCool AK620 and non overclocked I finally figure out the formula too achieve 4K ultra Gaming on most games that I play on a regular basis. I play numerous of strategy games but I do also play Grand Theft Auto (as an escape...) American truck simulator as of late and Roblox. The processing performance has been excellent. I hope that one day I can overclock one of these processors without having to worry about frequencies and voltages. Basically said it's it's 12th generation processor and that's been recent in the past two to three years. It is on the mid-range of the spectrum for Intel i5, but really just seems to automate on its own and it actively will try to lower utilization numbers once it's processed what it has to process. I can go through a hundred tabs an hour and not have to worry about internal latency. It's good"

As the description says it does not include stock dissipator, however it is necessary to acquire a better dissipator than that of Intel stock, especially if you plan to perform overclock. In summary, it is one of the best options for games and general use."

Bought at $149.99, Great Value for Q4 2023",24-12-2023,"Bought for a Mini-ITX Build for my daughter when it was on sale for $149.99, felt like a nice value for Q4 2023.  Didn't overclock this one, but could as it runs at just 48 degrees Celsius under load from Cinebench R23 with the (just-barely-fits-in-the-case) ThermalRight Peerless Assassin 120 SE ARBG.  Side note: for anybody building a PC, that Peerless Assassin is the CPU air cooling champion at ~$40.  This 12600k processor is more power hungry than some of it's AMD competitors, but having recently purchased an AMD 7800x3d for my own computer that's requiring a bit more work to optimize and get running properly, this 12600k was perfect.  Intel stuff in my experience just tends to run good."

Good chip, runs cool, still improving",07-07-2022,"I recently built an 15 12600k system and it has plenty of ups and downs. I don't see any of the downs being the fault of the chip or Intel. Most of the issues I have experienced with the new system (and there have been many), have to do with the motherboard or ddr5. I upgraded from a i7 4770k I had on a 24/7 4.8ghz overclock for 7 years. The new I5 is CLEARLY faster in both single and multi threaded performance. Like many I experience many errors in the windows 11 event viewer usually something to do with an efficiency core. At the end of the day I don't see any real world effects on performance, and even microsoft says to ignore these errors.I have traditionally chosen intel because of their on board graphics support. I've had a graphics card go out in the past and having on board video allows you to at least use your system as a system while you figure out what has happened. If amd ever decides to see the value in having on board video from an administrator perspective; I may have to reconsider them.I am happy with the upgrade to the new chip and support for the new technology will only get better. I would recommend the I5 12600k to anyone looking for a reasonably priced new chip that will allow their systems to handle most tasks with ease for the foreseeable future."

The best value CPU of this generation",28-08-2022,"Iâm so glad I decided to step up from the 12600T I was planning on using to the 12600K, which is the cheapest Intel CPU that has the efficiency cores. I was nervous at first, because my plan was to build a low-ish power, 100% passively-cooled, internal GPU, no moving parts PC for use in my bedroom, where my previous computers were annoyingly loud. I used a Noctua NH-P1 passive cooler and a Seasonic PX-500 fanless PSU, and my system is not only 100% silent, it turns in impressive benchmark numbers and never gets close to throttling temperatures even after sustained Cinebench runs.I run my system at -130 mV, with no overclocking, and CPU power consumption peaks at about 100 W, while idle CPU power consumption is less than 2W. My heatsink never gets too hot to touch with my bare hand in daily use. The only thing preventing my system from being a high performance gaming PC is the lack of dedicated GPU, but the internal GPU is more than enough for me to run four simultaneous instances of BlueStacks 5 to play my favorite mobile game, and fast enough to run Diablo III and EVE Online with medium settings.The Core i5-12600K is roughly competitive in performance and price with the AMD Ryzen 7 5700X."

Amazing CPU for the money!",09-03-2023,Just got it for my NZXT gaming PC custom build & seems to work great. Install was easy & doesn't have the annoying fragile socket pins older CPUs used to have. You just place it on the socket close the bracket install your cooler & it should be good to go. I seem to have very good frame rate stability & seems to be able to handle most games even without a GPU. If a game used to be on console it'll likely work with this CPU & perform better than gaming console CPUs. I used to use a basic mini PC with an older i7 6700T but with this in my gaming PC is have next to no issue running HD graphics in games like GTA 5. And its amazing for the price. Was going to go with an i7 13700K this ended up costing half the price of the i7 & an i7 may be a bit overkill for most of the games I plan on playing on my PC anyway. Only downside is the newer Intel graphics settings apps suck.

Pain in to setup. Nothing but a headache. I wish I would have got a different cpu.",23-01-2022,"No support for deepcool heatsinks, wasted time modifying it to fit, (it does work, but wasted a couple hours on a process that should take 5-10 minutes). I have never had so much trouble get a cpu to run in linux. Good grief, Iâm a computer expert by trade, and intel should have waited to release this series. I know the competition is tough, but I definitely wont go and buy another one of these. I thought it would be a good investment. I may have damage my motherboard on install, as the cpu slip out of my hands and banged up against the socket bent some pins. It was so hard to get running under linux, graphics support is nonexistent, i can only the XE2 new graphics cards will be more of the same since these are based on that Technology. You can find a work around on Phoronix for the graphics problem, however the image on linux sucks itâs more pixelated than i would like. I would like to mention I needed to my rx 580 to get this thing running as the Linux OS didnât recognize the GFX chip on the cpu. And with the way the situation is with gpuâs Iâm lucky to have had one at hand. The Bios also doesnât show on my pc correctly if you use the onboard Intel graphics, its cutoff . Also the hard drive was not recognized with the motherboard but it happed two motherboard asrock and gigabyte. I had to install a new elilo version to get the efi to work. What can i say the performance is good, but runs hot 120 watts at the cpu when doing multithreaded task like compiling the kernel. It does that fast but Ryzen 12 core does it faster and with less power 95watts. Itâs hard to say this was an upgrade, my head hurts whenever an issue comes up with this cpu. Now after about month of use the gfx is acting weird, it starts to fragment / pixelated and gets stuck. Iâm sure intel knows and I probably should have just gotten a kf series instead because it is so bad now i just left the dang rx 580 in the system. Maybe Iâm not the only one, Iâm sure a class action lawsuit is in the works. I have not been able to enjoy this since I purchased on day one. I would have returned this but then I would have to return the motherboard to another vendor and i sure donât want to go to that trouble. I fortunately got ddr4 version so I reduced the amount of ram in the computer and will use it as is until it dies. Hopefully after this crypto boom Iâll be able to snag a ryzen 5th gen combo for cheap. My intel can fix this but it will be years before this happens. They are too busy playing catch up. The power efficiency is terrible and the whole experience is about as bad as it gets. Save yourself a headache and get something comparable like a 3700x or better. This is not worth the price or painful install procedures. I just thought it was ridiculous coming from intel, didnt they create the PCs we know of today??? Did i mention the bios was cuttoff on left and right edges so you cant read the functions??? Iâm surprised Intel engineers released this, more of a sample than a final product. Buy something else, did i mention the cheapest motherboard sets you back around $200, so $500 into this ordeal is not a good experience, could have purchased 2 sets of used ryzen 7 8 core cpus and motherboard for the same money and ultimately gotten more performance in power usage and cpu. Thatâs my thoughts on this product."

Overall banger",03-06-2023,"Was really happy with this purchase. I had issues with a 5900x mother/cpu failing somewhere. This cpu runs the same performance (gaming wise) as the 5900x if not a tad bit faster and slower in certain games. Generally the same. Example Valorant on ryzen is 300-400 on this is 280-375 and mw2 on ryzen 230, on intel is 215 so not a huge drop and the cpu latency is MUCH more stable and low on this intel, compared to ryzen. Good fps and good speeds"
Kayden,5.0,"5.0 out of 5 stars
Make sure your motherboard is made for the CPU",18-09-2022,This is one of the best CPU for gaming and itâs deemed one of the best performance wise. Itâs also worth the money spent on it one of the best for casual gaming being able to run 180 FPS on games such as COD (as long as the gpu is good as well) When installing however ensure you purchase thermal paste before proceeding to remove or install the CPU. Thereâs a metal piece on the side of where the CPU sits in make sure you lift up before trying to getting the CPU out. But all around this is good for how much youâre paying just be careful as itâs very fragile and one drop may make itâs no longer usable.

Awesome CPU",11-07-2023,"It's one beast of a processor, there is no bones about it. Handles anything I can throw at it without trouble. Just make sure you get an adequate cooler. I personally paired it with a Thermalright peerless assassin (Arctic mx6 paste) which keeps it at 60 degrees Celsius under full load. If you're considering getting this CPU for your build, go for it. You will not regret it."

Impressive Performance Upgrade - A Mid-Range Powerhouse",10-12-2023,"I recently upgraded my PC's CPU to the Intel Core i5-12600KF from an older i7 6700k, and the improvement in performance has been nothing short of phenomenal. This processor has significantly boosted my PC's speed, making it feel at least five times faster than before.The addition of extra cores in the i5-12600KF is likely a major factor in this performance leap. It handles multitasking and demanding applications with remarkable ease, making my computing experience smoother and more efficient. Whether I'm gaming, working on intensive software, or just browsing, everything feels snappier and more responsive.What I appreciate most about the i5-12600KF is its balance of power and affordability. It's a fantastic middle-ground CPU that offers high-end performance without the hefty price tag of top-tier processors. This makes it an ideal choice for users like me who want a significant upgrade without breaking the bank.In conclusion, the Intel Core i5-12600KF is an excellent choice for anyone looking to upgrade their PC. Its ability to significantly boost performance, combined with its reasonable price, makes it a standout option in the mid-range CPU market. I highly recommend it to anyone looking to rejuvenate their computing experience."

I bought this processor (on a smoking coupon deal), a Z690 board for it, and a Z590 for the i7 11700KF from my old build to form the base of the two builds.I kind of agonized over which I would choose for myself - the 11th Gen i7 paired with the Z590 or this 12th Gen i5 with the Z690. I chose the latter, mostly because those parts came first and I was the one with the dead PC.Turns out that it didn't much matter. The i5 12600KF is every bit the equal of the i7 11700KF.

Intel is back baby!",13-02-2022,"FINALLY.  Intel has got back to being a contender.  I had not updated my computer since Kaby Lake... and I was a bit disappointed to see how thrashed Intel was getting by AMD.Luckily it was finally time to upgrade and my old system was dying... I had many things failing which was due to poor storage of the system while I was moving.These new 12th gen chips are blazing fast, and the prices are actually super competitive... also you can actually find them!  Originally, I was going to go with an AMD build this time - but finding the chips was getting harder and they were getting pricey.  Who would have thought that Intel was finally on the cheaper side of the competition!?This installed without any issues in my ASUS PRIME Motherboard, and was detected just fine, RAM was also no issue there either.  Seems RAM and Intel compatibility is still on the good side.Right now, these chips are going toe to toe with chips from AMD which are what I consider at least one tier above them, which is fantastic!  This level of competition is amazing for us consumers!Video editing and photo editing has been blazing fast for me so far, although I hate to admit I think the Apple M1 chips are still faster than these with WAY less power consumption.  I am a part time gamer though, so there is only one choice for me ;)You will not regret this purchase!"

Incredible Value CPU",15-04-2023,Amazing CPU handles everything I throw at it with ease and I'm able to run everything smoothly.I would like to add that for some weird reason windows wasn't using all cores and I suspected that I received the wrong one. In order to utilize all cores and use them to their max potential you need to make sure they are first of all enabled in the bios and only after that in windows you need to go to msconfig.msc > boot > advanced options > and uncheck the box with number of processors. This is very important otherwise windows will pretend that you don't have a 10 core CPU and give you false info under system info. and make sure to reboot for this to take effect. and when you do that windows will show that you have 10 cores CPU but still doesn't mean they are all in use. Download a software called QuickCPU and then change the power plan to high performance and at the bottom set everything to 100% and click apply. Once that is done congrats windows will use all the cores to their limit.

Be aware that you will need a UEFI and Secure Boot compliant video card.",28-01-2022,"I have been building desktop computers for the past 22 years, and this is the first processor I have had such horrible luck getting to work.  I have tried this in 3 motherboards, swapped RAM, video cards, power supplies, monitors, and HDMI cables.  I have even returned and replaced the CPU.  Nothing has gotten me to a POST screen, much less allowed me to access the UEFI/BIOS, until I borrowed a GT 1030, which is UEFI and Secure Boot compliant.  Socket 1700 motherboards are shipping with CSM disabled and Secure Boot enabled.  Unless your video card is compliant, you will not see a POST screen or a UEFI/BIOS menu.I'm going to sit on this system for a bit, while I save up for a newer video card.  The GTX 970 video card I have is not fully compliant, so it will not work with a socket 1700 system.--- AddendumI have now paired this with a GTX 1650, and the system boots up just fine.  I chose not to overclock.  Running a full load CPU stress test (4.5 GHz on all P-Cores, 3.6 GHz on all E-Cores), the chip draws less than 120 watts, and runs at 74C max temp using a Noctua NH-U12S Redux.So far, the system runs stably on Windows 11.  I hope this will be a problem-free build from here on in."

Great gaming CPU",12-08-2022,"I installed this in a GIGABYTE B660 Gaming X AX DDR4 since I'm not overclocking and the board has all the features I wanted at a good price.  It's paired with 16 GB DDR4 3200 CL14 RAM and a Phanteks 240 MP AIO liquid cooler. CPU temp never rose above 55 degrees during a 60 minute 100% CPU usage stress test with the stock Phantek fans.  With Noctua NF-A12x25 PWM fans, temp is in the high 40s during the same stress test.Running No Man's Sky at 2560Ã1080 resolution and ultra settings with a GTX 1080 and v-sync enabled, fps never drops below 70 and is over 100 with v-sync disabled.  My previous system had an i5-6400 which was usually at 100% CPU utilization while gaming.  Now CPU utilization hovers around 14%.Keep in mind the KF does not have the integrated Intel GPU so a discreet card is required.  This was a worthwhile upgrade and one I'm very happy with."

Download your graphics driver ASAP!!!",15-01-2022,"So basically i got it installed on my msi-z690 with the artic freezer 280 and did a clean windows install. I then let windows run all its updates and after the first reset the system would not open any programs or allow me to click IE to download drivers for my amd vega 64. luckly i had my laptop to usb the software safemoded the install and bingo everything so far is fast and amazing and im in intel heaven and my i7-7700k is in intel recycle bin. I cant believe how much cpu % is being used on this like in games the i7-7700k was about 79% but this i5 is at 28-33 % for wow/ffxiv/horzion dawn zero/gtav like im blown away. I also did not disable the e cores so have obs/yt and itunes up and at times a netflix show or anime i feel literally zero input lag with the core temp of 40ish so yes this is so much better then anything i have. Thanks intel. Also im not sure why its consider ""budget"" gaming cpu as this thing is outclassing high end cpus... just saying."

Fast processor",26-01-2023,"PSA: do not buy if you want to overclock and you plan on using Intel XTU on windows 10! Intel has dropped support for XTU on windows 10 for the 12th and 13th gen models, which i did not know at the time of purchase. Regardless, you may not even need to overclock this processor, it handles games, video editing, and large processing workloads well! I have been enjoying Intel's P/E core technology a lot, my background tasks running nominally, while my games and workloads execute smoothly. Amazing processor for it's price, but its definitely not the fastest. You should buy this as an in-between when building a new computer or when upgrading chipsets, etc."

Great bang for the buck...",01-08-2022,"When I saw this during the Prime Day deal, I thought it was something I had to buy on general principle, which I did.  Thus far, the chip is fast, runs Win 11 well and runs all the games I've tried on it easily.  Also, Intel has some neat utilities where, if one were inclined, may tinker with the performance.My CPU installed easily passing all of the stress tests.  It sits idle at around 26 - 28 C with simple AIO cooling, and only hits at around 60'ish during those more taxing times.  Again, for the price during Prime Day, it's a chip that one should buy on general principle, IMHO."

price/performance and a little older!",03-11-2023,"Picked this cpu up in August 2023. I upgraded from an i7 4770K to this beast. The i7 4770k was still capable, but honestly I wanted RCPS3 to run better because their getting closer to 75% of the library being playable. Also, I could tell my 8gb of g-skill sniper ram was holding me back and i could not for the life of me find 16gb of ram available that would run with trusted compatibility with my current board. The i9 12900kf hardly touches 20% usage for any new game and older games are even less usage while the video card sits at 99-100% usage, this is the sweet spot for no bottle necking and high performance.The video card is an RTX 2060 Super @ 1440P on Dell's 32"" monitor S3220DGF. With zero brightness and contrast at a hundred, the colors pop. I'd say comparable to OLED with those settings or at least IPS. The CPU is paired with the Z690 Strix motherboard and 32gb of Corsair vengeance ram. 32gb is the sweet spot. I watched a Linus Tech Tip video that said 8gb is good enough but when I run MSI afterburner along with Riva Tuner-statistics , the ram usage is usually between 10 and 12gb's used and sometimes as high as 14gb, with no known programs of mine running in the background. Perhaps we definitely passed the 8gb minimum by now. Itunes, Video Proc Converter, RPCS3, and Virtual DJ are some of my most demanding apps and this cpu just handles them like it's lite work I'm throwing at it. Well, there's the value. Highly recommending this chip but if you do go for it, be sure to pick up the Thermalright CPU Contact Frame for LGA 1700 Retrofit Kit or else, your cpu will burn, literally, thatâs the only caveat to the 12th generation."

outstanding performance and reliability",12-01-2024,"I recently upgraded my computer with the Intel Core i9-12900KF processor, and I am thoroughly impressed by its performance. The processor's hybrid architecture, combining Performance-cores (P-cores) and Efficient-cores (E-cores), offers an unparalleled computing experience. The multitasking capabilities are exceptional. I can run demanding applications, stream, and even engage in high-end gaming simultaneously without any lag. The P-cores deliver robust performance for heavy tasks, while the E-cores handle background activities, making everything from video editing to 3D rendering a breeze."

this is the best gaming CPU yet",21-07-2022,"i was a devoted AMD fan, until the X570 Ace started bothering me with the dreaded USB issue, after trying serval fixes, including Bios updates that came promising to fix the issue, also am a system builder since 2005, and as my part time business I build high end systems, and seeing how many stability issues AMD has from time to time I wanted to just give Intel a chance, and am glad i did, this is now in my main system, along with my trusty FTW3 3080, had to upgrade my motherboard and went with a Z690 Aero D, DDR5, am really happy with it, saw a noticeable improvement over the AMD with DDR5, at 1080p 1440p and 4k, but mainly I saw a great improvement in VR, i have to bring up that this isn't an advisable upgrade if you are running anything new gen, like AMD 5k or Intel 10th or 11th, as the differences will be negligible, but if you are in the market for the best right now, nothing that AMD offers at the moment competes as far as single core, or multi core for the most part, and ironically this time intel offers better value, good times indeed."

I'm not overclocking; that's just not the point of this system.  It crushes my i7 6700K-which i should hope that it does given six generations of chip architecture.  I'm looking forward to pushing this to see what it can really do, but so far, Cyberpunk 2077 and PoE play great.Beyond that, we'll wait and see.

M. Lane,4.0,"4.0 out of 5 stars
Its the best, so its pricy.",31-05-2022,"It's a good CPU, able to game and do the productive stuff. I paired it with DDR5. People say it gets hot but I haven't found that even though I'm only using a Noctua air cooler. Those little E cores actually do some work, and of course the P cores are fast. It's funny that the E cores are considered ""efficiency cores"" because they do use a lot of power.I think most consumers should get a 12700k or 12600k rather than this since they'll do just as well in games and since you can upgrade in less than a year. If you are running an app that uses all 16 cores, like a minecraft editor, then you may want to go for this 12900k, especially if you can find a sale.I've been playing Flight Sim 2020, Cyberpunk, Dota and Minecraft Java quite a bit with this and the only place it's weak is flightsim. That's not really the CPU's fault though because Flightsim is a very poorly written game which bottlenecks on the main thread. It's actually an argument for the KS version of this CPU. But alas, even I have limits."

some serious power. Gets very hot.",26-08-2022,"If you've seen anything about it, you'll know this bad boy loves to get fired up. Typically running cpu intense games at max graphics brought this chip up to 100Â°C! That's tjmax! Ouch! I have a kraken x52 strapped to it as well and still needed to undervolt, which is probably saving her life. Once you do though, And properly, there's honestly no performance drop. It's definately too good of a cpu for what I use it for, I just like to say I have it. Definitely water cool this thingz unless you know what you're doing. Also, you might want to get one of those thermal grizzly mounts for it. Do it right the first time you mount it, and don't let it bend under those extreme temperatures.  All in all, the cpu is extremely powerful! But it's a bit on the expensive side. Though, What do you expect. It's a flagship chip."

Awesome processor!",21-05-2022,"While I was away on a deployment I wanted to come back home to a little PC project, but wanted to build something more high-end (my previous build being an i7-9700K and 2080 Super). Luckily I heard about this i9 getting on the market and I was looking at the Ryzen 5900X, but I had a good experience with my previous Intel CPU (Nothing bad with the couple Ryzen builds Iâve had either).Anyways, long story short I built this heavy PC and the CPU has been an awesome choice! I paired it with my MSI Gaming X Trio 3080 Ti and an Samsung Odyssey G7 32â monitor and thing consistently gets to the 240 fps the monitor is capable of.Here are some pics of the build.

Buyerâs Remorse",22-06-2023,"If you buy a 12th or 13th gen Intel CPU, understand that youâre buying a chip that has a serious design flaw. The LGA 1700 contact pressure is nothing to overlook, and I wish I had of known about it before my purchase. It puts so much pressure on the chip that it flexes it to the point that youâll have serious thermal performance issues. Iâm talking 100c+ temps under load. There is a fix though: uninstall the cpu bracket on your motherboard, purchase an aftermarket CPU contact frame and install it. No more temp issues. Buying a high end chip and having to alter my motherboard with an aftermarket product just doesnât sit well with me. Stay away from 12th and 13th gen Intel CPUs, or buy a contact frame with it."

You need to go water cooling or get an EK Elite 360 D-RGB and some IC Diamond 24TIM if you want this cpu to run cooler and not have the temps go out of control on you. Any other AIO is not up to it, no matter how much it cost.  It can ran 4x16 3600 CL18 Corsair Vengeance RGB-Pro 3600 CL18 no issues, or Run 2x16 G.Skill Trident Royal Z 4000mhz CL16 B-Die no issues if you are on a Z690 DDR4 board.

Fantastic CPU",26-12-2021,"Overkill for gaming but who only uses their computer for gaming? Really fast especially if you're using a decent mb and ram.E-cores are kinda useless though hopefully they'll be better used over time. Some games see better frame rates with them disabled while others see better.... It's either an optimization issue or e-cores aren't as effective as they are marketed. Still, the chip is fast.The only issue that I can see is the use of drm-like nonsense which has been talked about at length at tech places. Apparently some people have had issues with some games/programs because of it. DRM is a curse as it only makes things annoying/difficult for those who buy things because those using pirated offerings always break DRM.I'm knocking the the rating down because of the DRM-like nonsense on the chip."

Giving it a crappy review because Intel should have foreseen this DDR5 shortage",13-12-2021,I though I was lucky when I snagged one of these right after it was released. Now my very expensive new computer is just sitting around collecting dust because of the worldwide shortage of DDR5 memory. Intel being such a massive company should have forseen this and used their resources or pressure to at least make sure the initial roll out had memory for the performance builders as we drive the market in the first place. Oh well.

The biggest jump in performance in many gens",05-12-2021,I usually buy every gen just play and most generates the improvement is marginal. This 12th gen is impressive. Makes the older gens not worth it unless they can be had for about half of what retail price is. 12th gen price to performance is incredible.I went with DDR4 MB because ddr5 plus ddr5 MB adds another $400+ to the system cost and for me wasnt worth it to play with for a test system. You can see from benchmarks online that ddr5 only really pulls ahead in certain applications and if you use or need those then go for DDR5 if you can find it. As of late 2021 ddr5 is really hard to find.

Great Processor But Can Run Hot Unless Tuned!",10-03-2024,"Upgraded from a 9900k and had a hotter running PC. Couldn't figure it out at first and found myself checking my AIO, reapplying thermal paste, checking settings, etc.  After research I was able to discover that given it a slight undervolt helps. What ended up helping even better and easier was ticking down the performance in the Performance Menu.In those option by simply ticking down the processor to 99% my temps went down to 55 for most of my games from initially running at average 80-85.  This tuning comes without a noticeable hit on FPS except while playing ""Squad"" (a single core use cpu intensive game).  With that game I do lose at least 10 fps by having the processor at 99%.  This is not that big of a deal as I can easily tick it up to 100% for Squad and just put up with the 75-80 temps!Happy that I can at least play most of my games at a good temp while gaining good performance by this upgrade!"

Still a great gaming CPU even after 3 generations.",03-10-2023,"This was Intel's top line CPU in the 11th generation; it used the LGA-1200 socket which was only minimally different from the LGA-1151 socket (1200 pins vs. 1151 pins).  The motherboards for the LGA-1200 required only small changes in production spec, and the coolers made for the 1151 chips work perfectly on the LGA-1200.  By contrast, the 12th generation, using the LGA-1700 socket, required an extensive redesign of motherboards, and the coolers that got adapted over from the LGA 1151/1200 didn't really work properly on the 12th and 13 generation Intel CPUs.  This i9-11900K will pull about 170 watts through the socket at factory overclock 100%, and that's right on the limit of safe operation for the vast majority of air or liquid coolers on the market today."

A Catch-Up Review from a 2022 i9-11900K Purchase",08-04-2024,"I am not a gamer by a long shot, but wanted a powerful Intel based CPU riding on an 'Asus Maximus Extreme Motherboard' along with a Asus RTX 4090 GPU. I purchased (1) of the most graphic intensive AAA game titles and a few CPU intensive military strategy simulation games known for their heavy demand for CPU physics computations. My Core i9-11900K which I purchased in 2022  performed admirably well on all accounts. Absolutely no complaints. Some reports say that the i9-11900K runs hot and sometimes above the 100Â°C mark? But that was not really the case with me or the many others when they installed a high quality 360mm or above sized AIO water cooler. My very demanding combat simulation (Command: Modern Operations) never presented a heating issue with the i9-11900K and with my over 80-hours of heavy duty play. For good measure my Cosmos C700M EATX case also includes a total of (7) additional  independent Noctua cooling fans, which of course benefits the cooling within the massive interior of the enclosure. Overall I am extremely satisfied with INTEL in general and recommend the i9-11900K and or its newer siblings now as a very good buy!"

A really good value from Intel for Intel based motherboards. It is capable of overclocking.",31-01-2024,This LGA 1200 cpu is robust and easy to overclock assuming your motherboard supports overclocking and your cpu cooler supports it. The base 3.5 GHz can easily support overclocking to 5GHz. I used the Intel Windows overclocking program and it was easy to do. The cpu installs easily and runs well.

i9 11900K to the rescue",04-12-2023,"I had an i7 10700 that went kaput on me, so I figured, why not upgrade to the overclockable 11900K, since it was only about 50 bucks more to the the fastest CPU my mobo can handle. I did install water cooling because it does run warm, but letâs just say this. My computer now works at warp 9.975. With the i9 10900k, a Nvidia 3060/12gb, and 128 GB DDR4 at 3200mhz, on userbenchmark website the lowest score I got was a 104% for gaming (UFO ranking). I overclock it a lot and it holds up well, and stays under 50c with the water cooling for me.11/10, would recommend, promote ahead of peers."

Great CPU",16-10-2022,"when i upgraded my desktop i decided to go intel core i9 this time. all my previous build was a 6th generation core i7 6700k. it ran fine but it wasnt up to running windows 11. so an upgrade was in order. besides, my old board was starting to fail. i originally bought a 10th generation core i9 10 core but that cpu  was junk. there wasnt enough PCI-e Lanes to support my drives and usb devices. this is a limitation of 10th generation CPUs not a limitation on the board. my video card (RTX 3070) took up most of the available PCI-e lanes which took out most of my drives. so i went to the 11th generation i9 8 core instead. very happy with it. it solved all my PCI-e lane issues. i am able to run all my devices and drives. the cpu clocks at 5.3ghz stable i have water cooling installed. i see zero problems with this chip. its fast, its stable im plenty happy with the upgrade. the board is a MSI MEG z590 ACE Gold. i have 64gb DDR4 3200."

Might be a defective CPU but dang this thing makes heat..",24-07-2021,The seller did an amazing job.The item came even sooner than expected.The bad news is that I installed it in my previously flawless running machine. The reason I upgraded from my current i910900k is that I wanted to enable the NVME.2 4.0 on my SSD. I already had the drive and a Z590 motherboard so why not right? I put the new i9 11900k In and it started and enabled the 4.0 on my NVME. Yay right! Literally with in a couple minutes I received a watchdog timeout error. (This is caused by CPU cores failing to communicate with each other.)I called Intel tech support who was less than help full. I updated all drivers and still didn't work.I did notice my CPU temp was running over 100c. Odd because I have the best nactura CPU cooler they sell. I decided to upgrade to a liquid CPU cooler and that brought my CPU temp down to around 85c.That still didn't fix the time out errors. I put my old CPU back and all is happy. I ended up sending the i9 11900k back but at least my i9 10900k is nice and cool even at 45% overclock. LOL

With this thing being $650 without a sale I would never buy it because I can get an i7 from the same gen or previous and it will be just as good. I will say that the photo is deceptive, it does not come in the package on the photo with the cool blue plastic box. It will come in a cardboard box like any other CPU.

Excellent value if it were priced lower",04-10-2022,"The 11th gen flagship i9 was a major step backwards in specs.  CPUs with 8 cores and 16 threads have recently been reserved for i7 SKUs.  Intel last-minute scaled this CPU back because of constraints with the older 14nm process.At launch, this CPU was a terrible value.  As of now, if you shop around you can find this CPU bundled with a Z590 motherboard at a very fair price.  I got into mine for under $410.00 with an ITX motherboard.  This suddenly changes the 11900K to being an excellent value.  It works extremely well but remember that 12th and 13th gen Intel i7/i9 will blow this out of the water."

A little disappointed in the packaging.",07-10-2022,"CPU is great. Not a bad deal if you are building a budget oriented high end PC. Performance is similar to the 10900k but has the PCIe gen 4 support which is the only justification for this CPU existance. This with a new z590 and depending if you already have DDR4 ram, this is 1/3 the cost of a new 12th existence.I will admit I am very disappointed in the box. The nice fancy one pictured is not the one sent. Instead you will receive your processor in a small cardboard box with Intel branding.

Surprising level of performance; use a liquid cooler for best performance.",06-09-2022,"I purchased this CPU during one of Amazon's infrequent and short-lived major price reductions. I paid $301.99 for the CPU at the time when it was selling for $389.99.  I wanted PCIe 4.0 and Thunderbolt 4.0 and I was considering a 5900X but I found the AMD X570 motherboard feature sets to be disappointing even at the high end. Anyway, I usually buy Intel Processors although I've occasionally bought AMD in the past.

Overkill, even for flight simulation",26-11-2022,"Having eight cores and hyperthreading makes for a very powerful processor. This is a very good ""overkill"" processor; that is to say, if you get this you'll outpace software for several years. It also has onboard graphics, so if you're buying this for rendering and just light computing, you'll be okay and won't have to buy a discrete graphics card like a GeForce.That said, this thing can sometimes get warm under heavy use, so a cooler is recommended.

Save on Computers",06-09-2021,"You really can't go wrong with these processors: however, Micro Center sells the Motherboard and the CPU for almost $150 less. As we went on their website, just about everything pertaining to computers is less. We build many high end computers in support of our churches and if you're building three or 4 that's a substantial savings. My husband is going to check it out and will probably purchase several units, to include the LGA 1700 with 12th generation processor if the savings are similar. Over the long haul it could save us thousands. We've had very few problems with Amazon and this does not reflect on them, but we donate these computers without cost to the churches. Our next effort will be some of our churches in El Paso thus hopefully we'll save a bunch"

Great cpu for the $300 i paid for",25-07-2022,So far Iâm really liking this cpu. I purchased it on prime day for $300 which imo isnât too bad compared to what it used to be and how expensive the 12 gen cpus are.Paired it with the z590 asus strix E that i got for $200 on prime days. Itâs working out pretty well.Also threw in the 3600 cl16 ram with it as this ram apparently runs well with it.Overall Iâm pretty happy with this purchase

Blazing fast new architecture",03-06-2021,"This CPU is fast, really fast.  Remove the power limits and let it's boost algorithms take over and it will blow your socks off.  You will need a good AIO or really beefy air cooler (or obviously a custom loop).  I went with the Cooler Master MasterLiquid ML240 Illusion, ordered an extra 2 of the Hallo Fans and set it up in a Push/Pull and under stress test8ng it stays in the 80s (with all power limits removed) while gaming it is usually in the 50's and occasionally the 60's if it is really intense.It is a tad on the pricey end but you want almost the same performance for less grab the 11700k"

high price with bad warranty service and bad quality",26-08-2021,"It does not worth buying this CPU. It is really expensive. I would expect it to be a good performance and good quality CPU and has good service, but it doesn't match my expectations. It is broken 10 days after I used it. My computer was certainly not able to open. After I google the issues and take it to a computer store, it seems like the CPU is broken and there are many defective merchandises in this product. So far, I am not happy but still can convince myself that I am just not lucky even I feel ridiculous about why such expensive items have so many defective products. I tried to use the warranty to get a new one or fix it, but Intel's customer service is ridiculous slow. After we tell them the issue, it has been a month and they are still verifying our information. it took them 4 days to reply us and told us what info they need. We sent them the information immediately. It took another 4 days to tell us that one of the information is wrong. We gave them the correct information immediately. This time, it took 10 days to tell us that purchase information is good, but they need the account holder to authorize the warranty  (why do not you tell us this at beginning?). After this, it has been several days and we still wait for the reply now. I do not understand why it takes so many days to just verify the customer information. Should not this be done in 1 days or even 1 hour? I understand it takes time to reply and communicate cross teams, but it still takes too long time. Especially, this is a high price item, it should have proper quality and service for this price."

Great budget processor",13-05-2022,"I have been using my 11400F for a few months now and I couldn't be happier with it, it's not a top of the line processor when compared to others of the same generation or the competition but for $150 Intel came in clutch with a great value for money to all budget gamers.I haven't yet found a game where this processor struggles or bottlenecks my graphics card and for daily usage/keeping things opened in the background it is literally a king. If you are upgrading from an older generation intel it will blow your mind how much faster processors have gotten over the years!All in all, I am happy with my purchase and will have this bad boy last me for a while."

Excellent choice if you don't need dedicated graphics",31-03-2021,"If you're looking to build a mid-range system and either don't need dedicated graphics or are waiting for the prices of graphics cards to return to the realm of sanity, this CPU is an excellent option, especially if paired with a B560 motherboard.  If you are planning on using a separate graphics card, check out the cheaper i5-11400F.  While the upper tiers of the newly-released 11th Gen Rocket Lake have received criticism for poor value relative to 10th Gen and poor performance relative to Ryzen 5000 series, the 11400 is a solid value.  It's a solid improvement over the 10400, and it is currently extremely difficult to acquire AMD processors with integrated GPUs.Quick review of Intel nomenclature:  An ""F"" designates a CPU without integrated graphics.  ""K"" designates an unlocked CPU that allows overclocking.  So the 11400 is a locked CPU with integrated graphics, while the 11400F is a locked CPU that will require a separate graphics card.All Intel CPUs (even non-K ones) technically allow for *memory* overclocking, just not overclocking the CPU itself.  However, previously, their B-series motherboards prevented memory overclocking, limiting RAM speeds to 2933MHz, and you had to buy an expensive Z-series board to use faster RAM.But with the 11th Gen, the B560 motherboards now support memory overclocking, thus improving the performance of budget and mid-range systems.  So a system built with an 11400F and B560 motherboard represents an excellent value.  If you don't need a GPU, or want to wait for prices to come down, getting an 11400 and using the integrated graphics is a very compelling option."
Larry,5.0,"5.0 out of 5 stars
The MVP of 2021?",01-04-2021,"Well, this is a pretty bad time to be a pc gamer. On top of the chip shortages, scalpers, and crypto mining craze, you can't even find a decent cpu with integrated graphics that plays modern games for less than $400... until now.Intel's 11th generation Core processors are pretty lackluster, however, they do have one thing going for them. The integrated graphics is good enough to play most esports titles @ 720p and medium settings over 60 fps. Not only that, it also comes priced under $200 and you can actually buy it.I was able to use this paired with the ASRock B560m Pro4/ac and 3200Mhz CL16 RAM to get a very nice system setup. ASRock let's the CPU stay clocked at 4.2-4.4Ghz at all times which is nice. I was also able to undervolt the vCore by -100mV and the temps came down good enough. Max load power consumption hits around 85-90 watts. Using the Aresgame River 5 cpu cooler, temps sit at 28C idle and 52C max load.I really can't find anything negative to say about this processor, it will definitely last you for several years once you get a graphics card. Until you do, the iGPU will at least let you play some games."

It's being cooled with an Arctic Freezer i13X, keeping temps under 72C even under stress testing.If you aren't running a super resource-hungry program, this chip will serve you well in most use cases.  It's competent in gaming, and holds its own in productivity and web browsing, with room to spare.  I really have nothing to complain about, here.At the time of this review, I cannot recommend 12th Gen Intel, so if you find an exceptionally good price on 11th Gen, pull the trigger.

No, you can't overclock it but overclocking isn't everything. GPU prices don't seem to be going down anytime soon so i'll see what comes up in a few months but didn't want to build a PC i can't even use and this is an good  stand in. Currently playing Tomb Raider (first one) on high settings with an average 40 fps (Ohhhh, it's not 60. Relax).If you're looking for something to do light gaming and other things while you either fork out the cash for a GPU or wait for God himself to reset the market, you cannot go wrong with this one.Oh, btw, did i mention you can actually use your PC?

Unlocked More PCIe Lanes?",17-04-2023,Have a Gigabyte B560 DS3H AC-Y1 motherboard that came with an i5-10400 and could only use one of the M.2 slots on the motherboard. Upgrading to the i5-11400 allowed for both M.2 slots to be used because we're NEVER going back to SATA SSDs!

Nice processor with very good performance but very hot.",21-06-2021,Great processor with great performance. Would give it 5 stars but it is extremely power hungree with stock settings & to a lesser degree even tuned for lower power while keeping performance. Forget anything close to the rated TDP as that is strictly base clock TDP which very few people will actually use.Rated TDP at base clock is 65 watts but when using turbo even with best settings at drew 140 watts & with out of box settings of motherboard it drew over 160 watts & throttled due to excess heat even with a good aftermarket heat pipe cooler. These powers are just for the processor alone. Not the whole system.

The true price/power of the market, goodbye Ryzen 3600",19-06-2021,"If you are building a mid-range gaming PC, this intel core i5 11400 is the best option of the moment. If you can get it at the normal price, you will take a more powerful processor than the ryzen 3600 and similar in gaming to the ryzen 5600. That is if you should know that the B560, H510 and other input boards for the eleventh generation are scarce and expensive. .The processor also offers a great multicore for video editing, and it doesn't get too hot. But for prevention I put a tower heatsink with 5 copper tubes."

Not worth the money",10-06-2022,"I paired with asus B560 strix a gaming wifi.  you can enable xmp. but, when you sync all cores and set it to 44 the most you will get is 42. In fact mine runs as 4189 as the base clock is off and no way to bump it up which also affects the memory speed. I don't know if the 12400 is any better, but this will be the last locked cpu I will buy. Unless your board has a base clock feature, it's second rate. Blew 400 bucks for nothing. Not enough frequency for what you pay. I would be happy with 4400mhz but I don't know if it's the board, the cpu, or both. Don't buy this for any performance application."

*The* 2021 value pick",03-05-2021,"~10% slower than the 5600X, but costs almost 40% less and itâs actually in stock. At the time of writing, finding a 5600X in stock is like trying to find a virgin in a whore house.Sure, itâs (yet another) 14nm CPU from Intel, but itâs got: substantial single-threaded gains compared to previous gen, PCIe 4.0, and B series motherboards now let you overclock the RAM.Itâs 6 cores/12 threads of âgood enoughâ goodness at a price no one can argue with. Slap a Hyper 212 Evo cooler on it, remove the TDP limits in the BIOS, and call it a day.Do I love a resurgent AMD? Absolutely. Would I have preferred an AMD chip? Absolutely. But ultimately, I go where the value is and currently, Intel (gasp) is the value leader.I think this chip will be a worthy successor to my 2500k (but make no mistake, prior to my 2500k, I was an AMD fanboy all the way.

Works with Z490 chip but better to get newer 11th gen m/b.  New Z590 can run 4th gen SSD and PCI 4.0 just like AMD.  Upgrade later to either faster 11th gen or new 12th gen CPU.

Solid 8 core product with nice OC features for enthusiasts; do some research first!",01-04-2021,"the i7 11700K 11th gen sits in between the well reviewed i5 and the poorly priced i9 11900k. I think at this price (I got it at pre-launch sale of $399) it's a good product. It's cheaper than the 5800X, performs very close to it and is a lot more fun to Overclock. Rocket Lake (11th gen) supports specific core overclocks to dial in ratios for the two best cores and other less hot cores. It also can take a tad bit more voltage than skylake++++ (1.45V load voltage supposedly safe according to Reddit AMA) although running at slightly lower all core clocks than comet lake with improved IPC. This actually seems to run slightly cooler for me but power draw can be pretty nuts on stress tests. Gaming load is not bad at all I was seeing around 100w on Horizon Zero Dawn.Unless you want the highest overclocks, the i7 can still get you pretty close or above the stock clocks of the i9 with manual tuning without the price premium and similar real world performance. Coming from the i9-10900k, the gaming FPS is pretty similar at UW 1440p, but rocket lake seems much more stable with overclocking - as in you get watch dog BSOD errors or you donât - not the WHEA stuff. The RAM gear stuff is a little overblown, the performance penalty of running 1:2 is not as bad as what you see on Ryzen. You can run very high speed ram 4800+ and looser timings and get a ton of performance from these chips. I'm an enthusiast and I've had Ryzen and Intel systems and I just enjoy tuning Intel CPUs.

Fast, Fairly priced, but...",25-04-2022,"...some of the draw backs are basically runs VERY hot even at idle compared to other generations (stays at 40+ C with 24 C ambient temp), but I concede I think I may need to adjust my case fan speeds to get a more aggressively positive pressure airflow in the case. HOWEVER< it barely gets much hotter under full load so perhaps I have tuned fairly well...Value is just OK. It is a bit lower than the 12th gen counterpart, and continually getting a bit cheaper all the time, but it is still close enough in price that if you CAN go with a 12th gen intel build, I would have just gone that route (I was pretty much limited with my choice of mobo, so i could only go as high as 11th gen intel and gen3 m.2).But it has been amazing so far in terms of performance under load, and I see this build carrying me for 4-5 years! I hope."

Great CPU",14-04-2021,"The media could not be loaded.

Rates as UFO on User Benchmark & is a very good CPU. For anyone who might wonder though it is not good for gaming unless you have a dedicated graphics card. So the person who answered my question & said it was great for no video card gaming on 1080p, they lied! Any way I am running it with an RX 560 4GB right now on my UHD 52"" TV on low settings unless video cards come back down to reasonable prices again & it works fine for the games I play. If you do not game or need use of powerful graphics its great for surfing the web, watching videos & streams. Otherwise I advise you find or have a video card if you want to game or what ever.Great CPU!Update 04/09/2024 - Currently I run this CPU with 96GB DDR4 3200, RTX 3060 Ti 8GB, 500GB WDBlack M2 as OS Drive, 4TB M2 for Games, 1KW PSU, I have 2x 240CFM fans on it, and 3 others to cool my system none of which I ever need to run about 25% air flow."

Just what I needed.",10-09-2021,"I know that there a lot of negative reviews for these 11th gen Intel chips but so far, it's just what I needed. My computer was dying. I put this chip on an Asus board and I have had zero problems, other than my old graphics card dying a few weeks later.Intel saved the day. I can't play my full Steam library, but I can use a good 85%. I can do everything else that I normally do without any overheating or slowdowns.Now I can wait for a while to see if graphics cards go on sale.Update(10/18/21) I've been going through my games(450+) and so far I can play them all. To name a few: GRIM DAWN,DIVINITY ORIGINAL SIN, TRIALS OF MANA, and BOOK OF DEMONS. No separate graphics card at all. As far as I'm concerned, this processor is well worth the money.A big thank you to Intel for helping us regular folks beat the scalpers. Let 'em choke on those triple priced cards."

Works great so far",05-04-2021,"May 2021 (sometime)- I decided the processor (I don't recommend you do that), it required a oven and a lot of patience. Long story short after delidding and applying liquid metal it dropped my Temps over 10C, I ran it that way for about 6 months before selling it to a friend but he hasn't had any issues yet eitherApril 12, 2021-for some reason my cpu is now shooting up to 100C the moment I do a stress test (within less than 2 seconds) causing it to throttle tremendously. I have changed nothing. I reseated my cooler thinking maybe it had shifted and that still didn't fix it. I am going to check through everything today, maybe something changed in my bios for some reason. If this can't be fixed I'll be sending it back or warrantying itSo far so good, I've been able to run this at 5.2Ghz on all cores for quite a while, gets a little warm but nothing that isn't manageable.  Seems like all the 1 star reviews are just people who like to comment on things they don't own."

Intel last and finest 14nm is nothing less than impressive!",09-06-2022,"Don't listen to the review on youtube, cus this is a legendary CPU. Before the 11th gen, the 10900K was the fastest gaming CPU in the market. And for Intel to top it, is impressive in itself. CPU if you pair it with the right motherboard and rams you will then see its full potential. I own the 12900K for over 6 months and decided to go back to the 11gen. Even though Alder lake is more powerful, since it is very new, it has way too many drawback and the high latency of rams is the main reason why I decided to sell it. I think Raptor lake would be the CPU but as of now, the 11 gen with a few tweaks will outperform alder lake."

Great cpu, runs hot.",11-04-2023,"Great cpu. My computer boots faster than my monitor wakes up. Programs open immediately and run well. The only down side to this cpu is that it eats 125 watts and produces quite a bit of heat. My case exhaust fans make noticeable noise keeping my case cool. Having said that, with proper cooling it is easy to keep the cpu under 70 c (under heavy load mine runs 58-65)."

Stable. Overkill for most people",06-05-2021,Great for gaming. Even tho AMD beats it in multi core workloads doesn't mean it's not a good processor. It's a stable reliable processor. And best of all it's in stock. In gaming it trades blows with my ryzen 5800x. So for I haven't run into any bugs or glitches. That's what you get with intel. Stability. If your only gaming I'd say this isn't the way to go. But my wife does do work station application and the extra cores reduce her time. I'd say this is niche processor and very few people would actually benefit from the extra cores. If your just gaming go with a 11600k. My daughter build is running an overclocked 11600k and it trades blows with this one.

Ryzen nanometer wars are reaching obvious limitations",21-05-2021,"My first upgrade since generation 4 i5-4670k, it's fantastic. I chose an Asus Z590 Prime, Corsair Capallex 110, RM 650W PSU. A learning curve on overclocking since 2010, I spent equally as much in ram, mobo and cooling but worth every cent. You'll still need graphics if running under GeForce 1000 Series, but my perfermance with a 960Gtx is phenomenal. Its an Intel entusiasts dream, and I agree: ignore the one star reviews. I won't make a Ryzen comparison, other than my title, I do believe AMD is doing less with more changes but just my opinion. Are threads, cores and nanometers winning? I have my doubts. Nonetheless this is Intel back on it's game!"
Jesse,5.0,"5.0 out of 5 stars
Terrific processor",21-05-2021,Wonderfully designed CPU.  For those that want low power consumption and low temps just leave it stock. The 3.6 Ghz to 5.0 boost is designed to make this processor the Swiss Army Knife of CPUs. Overclocks to 5.1 all-core easily on the Z590 motherboards. Yes it runs warm but you wanted an excuse to buy that 360mm AIO. Two cores can overclock to 5.2 if desired. Probably could get all 8 pretty close to that with an open loop system. Scores 116-118% on userbenchmarks. I like AMD but they just don't overclock as well. Plus this processor is readily available at retail price. Some of the hate surrounding this offering is extremely misguided.

Gen4.0 Gen4.0 and also........ Gen4.0",14-04-2021,"I really donât get why people arenât hyping the fact that you get almost TRIPLE the read&write speeds with these new chips being 4.0 gen. The only reason I upgraded/downgraded to this cpu is specifically for the gen 4 m.2 slots. Trust me. Invest in 2 980 proâs from Samsung, configure raid0 with them, make it a boot drive and BAM... Donât say I didnât tell ya. To avoid any hassle, make sure your motherboard has at least 2 PCEI 4.0 gen slots. Otherwise you may share bandwidth with other slots. In regards to the rest of the features this cpu has. Intel in my opinion is still top dawg when it comes to gaming & overclocking. Iâve enjoyed intels i9-9900k for a while now and if your like me and you want the best intel has to offer. So if your pockets are like my pockets youâll follow in someway what I plan to do. Right now the i9-11900k is sold out, but more importantly WAYYYYY to pricey!!! No prob just go to your local retailer and buy the i7-11700k!!! (Make sure you spend the extra dough on the *Retailerâs 1year or 2year warranty!!! When intel stops this temper tantrum from the $Rising Ryzens$ and lowers there i9-11900k considerably, or comes up with an even BETTER CPU!!! Then because you purchased the warranty, you can basically trade in your i7 for the i9 for no extra cost or even lower then what you paid for this i7. So if you got cash but still wanna save a few bucks, I highly recommend this method. Besides we gotta stay loyal to our intel boys and not switch over to the dark side. #threadskipper hahahah"

Better wait for Alder Lake",30-04-2021,"Got mine off B&H, but that doesnât matter anyways. Too bad I bought mine for like $450 on release day, lol. This CPU is very solid, but keep in mind that this thing is 10nm core architecture backported to 14nm. That is what I like to call DISASTER! This is just a 10700K but with a better iGPU. Good processor, but not worth the price tag."

I also installed a GEN4 NVME Drive as a oppose to the GEN3 NVME drive I had for the 7700k.  I can say the speed of doing any operation in windows is noticeably faster.

Top of the line CPU",24-06-2022,"I've watching the price on this processor for several weeks and saving my discretionary funds to upgrade from an i5 11600K. So, when new one came along on a well know auction site I made an offer and snagged it for $230. I ran it through its paces and it lives up to my expectations. I went as high as 5.0 GHz with Turbo Boost and it didn't disappoint, although it did get rather warm. Backed it down to 4.4 GHz and it only runs a couple of degrees warmer than my 11600K at the settings. But it outperforms it in all trials. Highly recommended!"

Price to performance is great",25-07-2022,"The i5 11600k is, at the time of this writing, really the best value in CPUs on the market. You have to pay a bunch more to get a couple more cores in an i7, while an i3 is only a bit cheaper for certainly less performance. Meanwhile, Ryzens are just too much extra money for frankly a little less performance. They may have a huge marketing cult, and they are very good processors to be sure, but if you're trying to maximize performance for the dollar, the Intel cores still have the edge. The i5 11600K is the strongest performing and most flexible of the gen 11 i5 variants and is plenty good enough for the casual to moderately serious gamer or workstation--especially if you dabble in overclocking, but also even if you don't, this is still a little stronger than the 65wtdp locked version.Keep in mind that the unlocked K version i5 is the full performance version and does not include a cooler like the locked i5s usually do. It's also rated to dissipate more heat which is surely why intel doesn't include one. I think the intel vs. ryzen people do entirely too much hand wringing over architecture and TDP differences between the brands. Guys, stop being silly. The truth is that unlocked intels and ryzens BOTH put out a ton of heat and both need coolers that exceed the rated TDP. For the 11600K I'd recommend a cooler in the 150w-190w TDP range. I ended up finding a good price on a Be Quiet Shadow Rock 3 which is a very nice air cooler for the i5 and probably overkill unless you're playing with overclocking. I'd also recommend the same for the congruent ryzen, by the way. The inconvenient truth is unlocked intel and ryzen both put out more heat than CPUs ought to be in this day and age and you need to spend some money on cooling any of them. At least with the 5s you can get away with upper mid-grade air cooling and definitely don't ""have"" to do water if you don't want to, especially if you're keeping to a budget.The 11600Ks generally support 3200 ram with no need for ram overclocking which is great, but check the capability of your particular motherboard. This is one of the improvements from 10th gen. I'm running a couple 16gb sticks of 3200 cl 16-18-18-38 with excellent results and no funny business in the bios.The intel integrated graphics on the 11600K is what you'd expect. It's fine for workstation/business use, can output 4k video content fine, and will get you by for light gaming, but serious gamers will obviously need discrete graphics. You can get the KF version of the 11600 if you don't want or need integrated graphics, but depending on the day, it may or may not actually be cheaper than the K.Overall, the i5 11600K really is the current value champion for mid to upper-mid grade PC builds in 2022 to date and will continue to be until the next big price drop on the 12th gen CPUs and motherboards. You get near-i7 performance for less money and you get a bit better than current ryzen 5 also for less money. Match this up with your favorite reasonably robust cooler and a good mid grade motherboard (I like Asus TUF, but you do you) for a really great bang for the buck PC build with some lasting power."

Extremely good CPU, albeit power hungry. 650 watt PSU is adequate for most systems.",07-04-2021,"Using this in the ASUS TUF Gaming Z590-Plus WiFi motherboard. To my surprise, it also came with its latest BIOS update, so no need to flash it so far.Coming from an i5-4690k, man... I'm just floored. This thing is insanely fast compared to what I'm used to. I was aware it could get rather hot as well, so I decided to get water cooling (AIO Cooler) for the very first time. Managed to fit the NZXT Kraken X53 in my Corsair Carbide 200R case. Rigged it just above my Low-Profile RAM sticks, with screws in the hexagonal grill with the included washers, and used Velcro to stabilize the frontal area, as there was no coverage for screws there.Spent all day building this, but hoo boy, it was worth it. Stable, fast, and ultimately, an absolute joy to game on. I'm still using my EVGA GTX 1660 Ti XC Ultra with this, as I've nothing better. However, I'm no longer CPU bottlenecked like I was before. Now it's maybe a 5 ~ 10% GPU bottleneck. Nothing too serious, and games run phenomenal. Zero issues. Temps never go above 65c with the aforementioned cooler. (Which I highly recommend, if you can both fit & afford it, it's about $140 including tax at the time of this review)16 GB of low-profile RAM fit perfectly with my build, and they're of the 3200 MHz kind. It only reaches that via XMP in bios, but that is intentional, so definitely use it if you have sticks like these. Goes great with the CPU. So far it varies between 4.6 GHz and 4.9 GHz all on its own, and so far I'm just leaving it that way. Typically stays at 4.9 GHz during heavy gaming. Temps are still good, below or around 60c depending on the game.Just know that air cooling may not be as safe for this one, not that I can attest to that personally. I almost chose to air cool it, but now that I've experienced liquid cooling, I'm not sure I can go back to air. Haha.I highly recommend this processor, as well as the cooler and motherboard I mentioned. RAM was the all-popular Corsair Vengeance kind, of course. Couldn't be happier!"

Excellent processor!",24-05-2022,"Excellent mid-range processor with a reasonable price. My budget did not allow me to go 12th generation, nor could I afford and i7. Paired this baby with an MSI Z590 WIFI Pro Series motherboard and I have not been disappointed.  I pushed it to 5.0 Ghz on the turbo boost setting and it blew away my previous 9th gen i7. Stress test after 10 minutes and everything was still rock solid. I backed it down to stock settings and it still performed very respectably. I don't do any gaming on my PC so I can't give an honest rating for it, but it had no problem with the Passmark benchmark. Besides, the graphics adaptor is the key in that realm.Highly recommend this if you are on a tight budget and looking for a good all around choice.Update - I wrote this review back in April but for some reason it never got posted. The only thing I can figure is they didn't like me mentioning overclocking it to 5.0 Ghz. Anyway, I have bee running it for nearly 3 months and I still could not be more pleased with it. All I can say is if you looking for a decent CPU for a reasonable price, then this one is for you."

Shouldn't have bought it, but I did anyway",16-03-2023,"I upgraded from a 10600kf to the 11600k. Its an almost entirely pointless upgrade and I don't recommend anybody else take this route. If you do, here's some more info...Pros:*Pcie gen 4, babyyyy*Performance is pretty solid so far*Definitely has overclock potential. I got it to 4.9ghz all core with just a 2-fan water cooler. I couldn't run it as a daily driver with that cooling setup, but it DID work. Lol.Cons:*Gave me a hard time with setting ram speeds for some reason. 10600 allowed me to set ram at 3600 but the 11600 gets grumpy if I go over 3400*Price to performance didn't make any sense for me to upgrade...but I did it anyway. I guess this is kinda a neutral thing?If you're like me and you just want to have the highest gen you can get for your board, it's a nice chip.It doesn't come with any thermal paste anywhere in-box so just make sure you have some laying around. I recommend Noctua NT-H.It doesn't include a fan. If you're upgrading from 10th gen, you can use the same fan. If you're doing a new build just make sure you've got a fan.

The onboard graphics are better than the 10th Gen i5 10500",18-06-2021,"I own a Gigabyte Z490M Gaming X motherboard.  It has two M.2 slots, but one that doesn't work (labeled limited functionality).  It turns out that Gigabyte built ahead to provide added functionality once the 11th Gen processors were released.  So, when the new processors came out, I replaced my 10th Gen i5 10500 processor with this one.  Initially, I noticed six things:1.  This processor requires more power (125 watts vs 65 watts for the i5 10500)2.  Even though it uses twice the power, it only runs about 4 degrees Celsius hotter under an average or light workload.  (I used the same 120mm liquid cooler for both).3.  The onboard graphics are noticeably improved over the previous generation chip.4.  The processor doesn't feel twice as fast, but is noticeably faster than the 10th gen i5 10500 (which was a solid processor too).5.  My second M.2 slot on my motherboard now works due to the functionality of the 11th-gen 11600k.  Currently, I use one slot for my Intel WiFi card and one for my uber-fast M.2 hard drive.  This frees up a ton of room on my PCI-Express ports for a really nice video card.6.  My motherboard required a firmware update in advance of installing the processor.Words of caution before buying:1.  Make sure your motherboard has the right socket type: LGA1200.2.  Make sure your power supply has not just the four-pin power connection, but also a second 4-pin power connector (for a total of 8 pins).  Most 600 Watt or bigger ATX or ITX power supplies should probably work.  Often the two plugs have a connection to plug them together side-by-side before plugging into the motherboard.  Don't try to use the other connector intended for a video card.3.  Make sure you have the correct firmware installed BEFORE you try to install the new processor.  Otherwise, you'll waste time and thermal paste and will have to reinstall your old processor, install the firmware update, test it, and then reinstall the new processor.4.  Recalibrate your fans if needed afterwards.My computer boots faster, plays Minecraft at a higher frame rate, and doesn't run significantly hotter.  I don't overclock it.  It was just so close in price to the next model down a the time, that I decided to get it."

The Base",27-05-2023,"Being an i5 type this is the ""base"" of Intel processors. You can get the i5 types in all generations including the latest 13th-generation processors that just came out. Do your homework and see which generation/i version (i5, i7, i9) will do the best job for you. Just buying the cheapest is as foolish as buying the most expensive for no real reason. Keep in mind most i9 versions are 125 watts or more and cooling those processors is a skill in itself."

Great CPU but not sure what ""easy to lock"" is",17-12-2021,"For the money this CPU is a steal, i bought this one because of the price to performance ratio and so far its ran everything amazingly, no issues at all.  Ive had programs loading slow but i think thats another issue not associated with the CPU I have m.2 nvme drives so not sure whats going on but things like steam want to load really slow but i was having that issue before my upgrade so i think its related to that. AS far as the CPU itself im running battlefield 2042 with it and a 3080 and getting close to 140 fps which is really good i think considering how unoptimized that lunatic piece of software is. I have zero idea what easy to lock is it asks for in the review but i gave it five stars anyway because this does everything you could want from it. I bought it for gaming, not sure how it would do with productivity or video editing stuff but im sure just the same.  Great bargain for a top of the line gaming cpu."

The motherboard wouldn't handle the 12th gen cpu. No worries though. Went to Best Buy and picked up an ASUS Z690-Plus wifi D4, and built the system.Anyways, I was in the mood to build another system, and had everything but the cpu, case, and M.2 drive. So Ordered this cpu, in hopes I'd get the right one this time. I did. Last night, my 13yr old son and I built it. This is his2nd computer, but 1st build. Took us a while, but he did it.The CPU works great. We noticed, right off the bat, how quick it was. Less than 20 seconds from a cold system to fully into windows 11. We haven't even touched on OC'ing it yet, but will once we get some liquid cooling going. He's loving it, which is all that matters."

Over all system has improved, and page rendering improved 90 percent. This was especially noticeable with Microsoft Edge.

But I immediately noticed a significant improvement in GTA V Online as I went from my graphics card utilization being in the mid 50's to low 90's% usage to almost always at 99 - 100% usage in demanding areas and that ofcourse increased my fps by almost 30-40%. I used to get random stuttering as well and that is completely gone now and I don't even need to overclock this processor as it stays at 4.6 ghz with the intel and Asus boost technology for my Asus Prime B560 plus motherboard.For under $250 this is bargain super chip for gamers and should be good for streamers as well."

Buggy bios do not buy yet.",02-04-2021,Wouldn't boot with my ram at its usual stable xmp settings even though it's worked fine for over a year with my old processor and it runs insanely hot. Will be returning and going back to my i3 10100. Will probably get a tried and tested 10th gen cpu instead because they are cheap and reliable right now. Maybe in 6 months when the mobo manufacturers fix their bios 11th gen will be viable.

What the hell... There is no rocket lake 11th gen driver!!? beware customers",03-04-2021,Why did Intel launch this CPU when the driver isnt ready? Someone at Intel told me its not ready and coming in few weeks.......just sad they want your money first

Worth every penny",08-04-2021,"I love this cpu! It is fast stable overclocking it is pretty easy and stays cool!!! The onboard graphics is really powerful and can play lots of powerful cpu based games like wow on high graphics for casual play without a problem. Cheap, efficient, powerful and supports pcie 4 so the new nvme cards are really fast at data transfers and complex disk space multitasking. Very reasonable for a casual gamer that doesnt want to spend 5 thousand dollars on a graphics card just to play mmos or multitasking and higher function processes."

Excellent For Gaming",28-01-2022,"I went from a 4790K to this and love it. Does everything I want and more. I had the 4790K overclockedperfectly after much tweaking. This 11600K doesn't overclock the same because its pretty much OC'dout of the box. It says 3.9 base but its really 4.9 base once you set it up. I was nervous it would runhot but I'm using an H100i AIO and it only gets up to around 60ish when gaming full on with a moderntitle. It can do some light work loads too, if you say want to edit a video. If you need to do that on aconstant basis, this is not for you, but if your doing light work and gaming, for the price right now itsamazingly goodly."

Great Budget Performance",12-08-2022,"If you're on a budget, playing at 1080p and want pretty stellar performance this is the CPU for you. It's given me zero problems with games like Forza Horizon 5, Anthem, A Plagues Tale, Sea of Theives and so on paired with a 1660Super. The GPU is very much a bottle neck and I still get 80-100fps on high or ultra settings. If you need something to hold you for a little while till you can upgrade or even stuck with this CPU, I can definitely recommend it."

Amazzingggg CPU",28-05-2022,6c/12t what more could you want for $200.  Its very fast and even though the TDP is 125w it almost never needs this much power for normal use and even in games.  The TDP scared me at first as I only used 65w processors in the past but man was I happy with the temps.I use the Scythe Fuma 2 Reb b and it idles between 29-35 and never gets above 55 when gaming.Can't recommend it enough.  very snappy for web browsing and daily tasks.  Excellent price point as well.

It works extremely well doing both ""easy"" tasks, like just booting up, and more ""difficult"" ones, like running video games that are known to have steep requirements."
